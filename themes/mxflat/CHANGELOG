v0.7.4 (ta)    2003-04-09
 -added periodic title string update option; the interval is adjustable
 -fixed bug with button positions where gaps in the titlebar could be
 	created (as it seems i simply mixed up left and right)

v0.7.3 (ta)    2003-01-19
 -added button icon set option, we now have different button icon sets
   that are chooseable, ie have other icons than the default ones with
   different sizes
 -added some more very small scripts that help me develop the theme
 -changed names of title string vars $height and $width to $width-content
   and $height-content because they contain only the width and height
   of the content window
 -titlestring vars $depth, $width and $height were also added
 -added .ctags file
 -improved theme updating speed a bit of some options
 -added title vertical alignment option (besides the alignment options
   can be turned of completely now)
 -clean up & reformatting
 -changed/improved internal button handling a bit
   (in the hope that this will make work easier in the future)
 -buttons now have a default (built-in) keymap
   (custom keymaps are still possible of course)
 -changed button position/keymap grouping
 -added look position button
 -fixed title string alignment bug for non-gradient mode
 -corner width adjustment is configurable for maximized windows
 -fixed a bugs in colorspace conversion
   (rgb2hsv: ignore the alpha channel for calculation;
   fixed rounding loss in both functions)
 
v0.7.2 (ta)    2002-12-24
 -fixed some minor other bugs
 -changed direction of button position models,
   negative value now mean left and positiv values mean right
 -clean up & reformatting
 -implemented experimental gradient titlebar mode
 -the left and right offset for the buttons can be set independently
   (they were both 1 before (hardcoded)
 -the buttons are resizeable (not only the icons, the whole button)
   (this includes an alignment option)
 -more configurable button colors
 -many color options can be turn on/off so one doesn't
   have to fiddle around with colors too much
 -another level of config tabs was introduced to make the navigation easier
 -no more compiler warnings when you run 'comile', yes, we made it :)
 -set tooltips with default bindings for all keymap defcustom options
 -an 'always-on-top' button was added (the button is, of course, deactivated by default)
 -the fake-shadow is working in a very basic version (the window corners arent respected)
 -the theme knows about vertically and horizontally maximized windows and
   sets the corners and borders accordingly
 -clean up button code
 -the titlebar frame part is no longer behind the top border
 -fixed a bug with 'real-center' title-x-alignment that occured when the title string could
   not be in the center because there was a button in the way
 -border width of focused window is adjustable (cpu intensive and turned off by default)
 -fixed a bug with maximized windows, the corner width adjustment
   is only taken into account on not-maximized windows
 -button3 click on the configure button toggles "custom-title" option
   button2 click toggles show-workspace-buttons option
   (somehow that isn't shown in sawfish-ui, but it's there, believe me!)
 -fixed a bug with the title x-alignment when the title of a window changes

v0.7.1 (ta)    2002-12-12
 -do not make such big version changes anymore, there's much to do till v1.0
 -real-center mode for title string x-alignment
 -2 new buttons: info and customize (not visible by default)
 -button-size is 9 pixel, they've actually always been 9 pixel big but there
   was a small transparent border, that i've cut off so that one can make the
   titlebar even smaller
 -all buttons icons are resizeable, i know the quality is not perfect, but we may include
   different butten sizes in future releases
 -changed the possible number range of many options
 -introduced 3 different decoration modes (normal, all, none)
 -it is possible to keep the window frame displayed, even when your windows are shaded
 -border offset in bigger ranges (not that anyone would need this ;-))
 -the last and first wirkspace is not adjustable anymore, this is done automatically now
 -set tooltips for many options
 -window corners are adjustable in width and length now
 -title string pattern customizable with variables (built-in and envitonment vars or rep-functions)
 -fixed title left/right alignment introducing title-x-adjustment option
 -the titlebar disappears instead of being behind the buttons when the window is too small
 -changed the button position model (buttons with position >0 are drawn on the left
   edge and with position <0 on the right edge);
   buttons models: title (button positions as multiple of titlebar height), pixel and none
 -the border width is adjustable for maximized and unmaximized windows
   (NEEDS FIXING, this is not really working yet, it was only introduced because this is needed
   for future features)
 -the width of the line between titlebar contents window is adjustable
 -code cleanup, reformatting
 -much more colors adjustable and thus some new config groups

v0.7 (ta)   2002-11-24
 -adjusted default colors
 -border offset is adjustable (range -1 - 1) because many gtk2 apps draw a small
   black border around their contents window and with a border offset of
   1 the sawfish window border will overlay the gtk2 border exactly;
   no more ugly gtk2 windows!
 -focused/unfocused button foreground color is adjustable through image recolor
   function taken from crux theme
   (the button images were all changed, we now only need one image for
   one button icon, the focused/unfocused color change is done through recoloring)
 -split button configuration into 3 tabs (misc/basic/extended)
 -next/prev button indicates when you are on your first/last workspace
   (set the workspace to -10 or something else if you don't want the button to change,
   but be aware of the default keymap of the next-prev button, if you button-3 click one of them
   many workspaces might be created)
 -button3 click on next/prev button brings you to your first/last workspace
   (you have to manually adjust your first/last workspace in the mxflat theme
   configuration group/tab; this is because i cannot (or i do not know how to) get
   the number of workspaces from within a theme since this information seemes
   to be restriced)
   (note: this is only for the default keymap, if you've changed the next/prev button's
   keymap it will stay as it is)
 -it is now possible to display the window/app icon on the menu button
   and to set its size
 -further reformatting and clean-up
 -the highlighted and clicked bg color of buttons of unfocused windows is now
   adjustable

v0.6 (ta)   2002-11-14
 2 new buttons (next and previous workspace)
 several additions, border fixes, code cleanup
 code reformatting (you may not like it but note that i am not
 very firm with lisp/rep yet and i think  it helps me
 to understand the code easier. besides i am sure the code can
 still be optimized (in length) if you know more about
 lisp than i do)

v0.5/unofficial (ta)   2002
 initial version from mx with help of me
 we ripped of the code from several
 other themes but mx created the imagaes of his own
 inspired by the mono theme i think
