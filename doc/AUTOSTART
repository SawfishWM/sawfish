settings directly from Sawfish.

whether to auto-start Fehlstart or not.

and clock. A sample pancakerc is supplied with the pancake source.

In SawfishConfig => Misc => External Applications you can choose whether

any setting trayer provides and whether to auto-start it.

=== xgamma ===

This module allows you to control your monitor's gamma settings. Configuration
can be done via SawfishConfig => Misc => External Applications. You can modify
the RGB channels separately. Changes will take effect immediately and on next
start if you choose to do so.

=== xmobar ===

This module allows you to control a xmobar instance per-session.

xmobar is a on-screen panel displaying output of any command you want it to.

NOTE: In your xmobar configuration file set "lowerOnStart" to "False" if you
experience that xmobar is invisible on startup.

In SawfishConfig => Misc => External Applications you can choose whether to
auto-start xmobar with Sawfish and what configuration file to load. By default
that is $HOME/.xmobarrc.

=== xmodmap ===

This module allows you to load a keymap using xmodmap. By default $HOME/.Xmodmap
is used. In SawfishConfig => Misc => External Applications you can choose whether
to start xmodmap on Sawfish start and what configuration file to load.

Before the file is loaded, sawfish saves the default keymap. Before restarting
Sawfish the restored keymap is loaded (and after restart the modifed re-loaded.

This ensures you can always use (restore-keymap) in order to (pseudo)undo the
changes to your keymap done by xmodmap. Useful when playing around with xmodmap.

=== xsettingsd ===

xsettingsd is a daemon that implements the XSettings protocoll and as such it allows
GTK+ (or any other compliant toolkit) to get it's settings like theme, icon-theme,
cursor-theme or font from it.

To get your current configuration you can do this:

run `gnome-settings-daemon' and then `sawfish-client -f dump-xsettings'

this will convert GSD settings to XSD settings. Be aware: if you use GSD from GNOME3,
the Net/Theme property will contain a GTK+3 theme.

So check this value in $HOME/.xsettingsd first and change it to a valid GTK+2 theme.
Alternatively you can grab and modify the file XSettings shipped in our source-directory.

In SawfishConfig => Misc => External Applications you can choose whether to auto-start
xsettingsd and what configuration file to use, by default $HOME/.xsettingsd
