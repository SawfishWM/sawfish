	* sawmill-defaults.jl: add shade-hover to the list of features
	required by customize

2000-01-28  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* menus.jl (root-menu): removed the `About' menu, it didn't

	* workspace.jl (ws-move-workspace): fixed this function
	(realized that there are four cases to the id transforms)

	* gnome-int.jl: don't use the gnome cc to invoke the
	configurator for now, they're are some issues to be resolved

	* customize.jl, custom.jl: custom groups are now organized as a
	tree. Specify the list of nodes to identify a subtree.
	Top-level groups are still addressable as single symbols. So,
	e.g., there's now a group `(appearance advanced)'

	* keymaps.jl (custom-keymap-group-widget): fixed for tree
	organization

	* workspace.jl, move-resize.jl, functions.jl, focus.jl: moved
	some customizations to `advanced' subgroups

	custom-required, if the user wants anymore, or has a
	.sawmillrc, they'll need to do it themselves

	don't add their features to custom-required anymore

	for sticky windows

2000-01-23  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	sticky and sticky-viewport properties more correctly
	* sawmill-gaol.jl: add call-after-state-changed to the list of
	safe functions
	[ these are mostly by James Antill <james@and.org> ]

	otherwise many strings aren't translated up correctly

	* window-order.jl, stacking.jl, shading.jl, maximize.jl,
	frames.jl: use add-swapped-properties

	match-window.jl, gnome.jl: updated to use the new workspace

	* x-cycle.jl, window-order.jl, stacking.jl, smart-placement.jl:
	use window-in-workspace-p and windows-share-workspace-p

	* workspace.jl (select-workspace): only hide/show windows whose
	`placed' property is set

	modifier

	* workspace.jl (ws-after-removing-window): fix the logic
	deciding when it's necessary to switch workspaces after merging

	whether single direction resizes can be upgraded to two
	directions

	* smart-placement.jl (sp-max-queued-events): increased from 20

	* match-window.jl: added pseudo-properties: position and

	property names: fixed-position => sticky-viewport, and
	focus-proxy-click => focus-click-through

	* menus.jl (menu-preprocessor): deprecated the ``expand

	* workspace.jl, transient.jl, stacking.jl, group-funs.jl,

	* match-window.jl: new file, a method of matching windows (by
	their X properties) to sawmill window properties without the
	need for custom hook functions. Will get a GUI at some point

1999-11-29  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* functions.jl (warp-cursor-to-window): rewritten in lisp; also
	when given no position it focuses on the inside top-left corner
	of the frame, should overlay more frame styles

	* maximize.jl (maximize-expand-edges): fix typos from updates
	for single namespace (GÈrard Milmeister <gemi@bluewin.ch>)

	gravity (mostly from merlin <merlin@merlin.org>)

	* menus.jl (window-ops-menu): added maximize-fill menus

	* edges.jl (get-visible-window-edges): new arg :windows,
	supplies the list of windows to include. The edge structure is

	window-order-focus-most-recent if not in enter-exit focus mode

	* transient.jl (transient-unmap-window): unless enter-exit
	focus mode, refocus the most recently focused window

	* smart-placement.jl (sp-prune-points): try to prune the grid
