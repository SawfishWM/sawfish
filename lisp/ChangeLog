2001-10-14  John Harper  <jsh@unfactored.org>

	* version 1.0.1

2001-09-20  John Harper  <jsh@unfactored.org>

	* sawfish/wm/workspace.jl (select-workspace): fixed bug in last
	change, don't keep the server grabbed for so long

2001-09-19  John Harper  <jsh@unfactored.org>

	Fixed bug of window flicker when switching workspaces:

	* sawfish/wm/workspace.jl (select-workspace): don't remove all
	windows not in the new space, then add all windows in the new
	space. Instead add all windows in the new space in
	top-to-bottom order, then remove unneeded windows
	bottom-to-top. This always generates the minimum exposed area

2001-09-17  John Harper  <jsh@unfactored.org>

	* sawfish/wm/commands.jl (apply-command-keys): fixed type of
	'dommand-doc instead of 'command-doc. Spotted by David Bustos
	<bustos@its.caltech.edu>

2001-09-14  John Harper  <jsh@pixelslut.com>

	* sawfish/wm.jl: when possible, disable error reporting on
	stdio streams

2001-09-13  John Harper  <jsh@pixelslut.com>

	Fixed bug of nautilus desktop window covering panel:

	* sawfish/wm/state/wm-spec.jl (desktop-layer, dock-layer): set
	to -/+ 4 respectively, not -/+ 1(which are the actual values
	used in the GNOME 1 spec)

2001-09-02  John Harper  <jsh@pixelslut.com>

	Fixed 6693 (restarting sawfish with a maximized window and the
	gnome panel will make the maximized window too big):

	* ~/src/sawfish/lisp/sawfish/wm/state/maximize.jl
	(property-notify): don't install check-if-maximizable into the
	add-window-hook immediately. Instead use
	after-initialization-hook to run c-i-m over all windows, then
	install it as before

2001-08-31  John Harper  <jsh@pixelslut.com>

	* ~/src/sawfish/lisp/sawfish/wm/util/stacking.jl
	(maybe-raise-window, maybe-lower-window): when adding server
	timestamp to the client message, subtract one from the actual
	last seen timestamp. Done for same reason as in windows.c

	* ~/src/sawfish/lisp/sawfish/wm/util/display-window.jl
	(display-window-without-focusing): new (private) keyword
	parameter WILL-REFOCUS. Pass this value along to
	select-workspace

	(display-window): pass WILL-REFOCUS as true when we'll be
	focusing a window afterwards (helps avoid some race conditions)

2001-08-24  John Harper  <jsh@pixelslut.com>

	* sawfish/wm/menus.jl: ensure menu-process is nil after being
	killed. Also, never try to kill it unless it's non-nil

2001-08-23  John Harper  <jsh@pixelslut.com>

	* sawfish/wm/commands.jl (no-operation): new command. Fixes
	8463

	* sawfish/wm/state/configure.jl (configure-request-handler):
	don't allow the window to be moved or resized when it's
	maximized. Fixes 8410

	* sawfish/wm/state/maximize.jl (window-locked-vertically-p,
	window-locked-horizontally-p): new functions

	* sawfish/wm/placement.jl (place-window-randomly): removed
	bogus middle cases from from x and y position calculations.
	Fixes 8415

	* sawfish/wm/ext/match-window.jl
	(match-window-grab-x-property): take a symbol with the actual
	name of the X property, not one of the strings in the
	match-window-x-properties list

Sat Aug 18 16:32:37 2001  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* sawfish/wm/windows.jl: Offset windows properly whose gravity
	point is centered horizontally or vertically.

2001-07-23  John Harper  <jsh@pixelslut.com>

	* sawfish/wm/state/gnome.jl (gnome-event-proxyer): fixed bug
	caused by Click1 events now printing as Click. This caused only
	button-release events to be proxied

2001-07-02  John Harper  <jsh@pixelslut.com>

	* version 0.99

2001-06-18  John Harper  <jsh@pixelslut.com>

	* sawfish/wm/menus.jl (menu-program-stays-running): by popular
	demand this now defaults to `t'

	* sawfish/wm/windows.jl (focus-desktop): new command, focuses
	the desktop window if one exists

2001-06-04  John Harper  <jsh@pixelslut.com>

	* sawfish/wm/commands/move-resize.jl (do-move-resize): move the
	call to draw-window-outline to immediately before entering the
	recursive event loop (avoids drawing and not erasing it on a
	non-viable drag)

2001-05-04  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/state/gnome.jl (gnome-event-proxyer): support
	`OffN' events
	* sawfish/wm/util/decode-events.jl: ditto

	* sawfish/wm/keymaps.jl (title-keymap): bind
	toggle-window-shaded to an X-Off2 binding instead of X-Click2

2001-04-22  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 4250 (pointer can confuse focus follows mouse when
	cycling):

	* sawfish/wm/focus.jl (focus-ignore-pointer-events): new
	variable. When true, pointer in/out events have no effect on
	the input focus

	* sawfish/wm/commands/x-cycle.jl (cycle-begin): while cycling
	set focus-ignore-pointer-events to true. Don't restore it to
	false until 100ms after the cycling finishes (so that any
	pointer out events generated by, e.g., removing the message
	window are ignored)

2001-04-22  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/viewport.jl (set-viewport): rewrote the code that
	changes viewports. It now tries to order the window moves in
	such a way as to minimize redundant pointer in/out and expose
	events. The ordering algorithm was suggested by Jan Kasprzak
	<kas@informatics.muni.cz> last September

2001-04-20  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/state/gnome.jl (gnome-property-handler): monitor
	_WIN_AREA as well as _WIN_WORKSPACE. This definitely
	fundamentally flawed, but can be useful in some cases..

	Extra i18n work. Adapted from a patch by Vlad Harchev
	<hvv@hippo.ru>

	* sawfish/wm.jl (i18n-defvar, i18n-define): new macros, expand
	to a `defvar' or `define'. Just used to mark variables that
	need special attention when extracting translatable strings

	* sawfish/wm/ext/match-window.jl: import sawfish.wm instead of
	a bunch of specific modules, so we get i18n-defvar. Then use it
	when declaring match-window-x-properties and
	match-window-properties

2001-04-17  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/ext/beos-window-menu.jl (make-label): surround the
	name in parentheses if the window is on a different viewport as
	well as if it's on a different workspace

2001-04-12  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/frames.jl (apply-frame-style,
	apply-frame-style-and-save): new functions. These provide a
	future-proof interface for programmatically selecting themes

2001-04-11  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	Committed some work-in-progress changes. The end goal is to
	store customized keymaps as deltas from their default value.
	That doesn't happen yet, but these changes will make it easier.

	Work to record default values of all custom options:

	* sawfish/wm/custom.jl (variable-default-value,
	variable-declared-p): new functions

	(custom-declare-variable): new keyword parameter DEFAULT-VALUE.

	(defcustom): the expansion now passes the DEFAULT-VALUE to
	custom-declare-variable

	* sawfish/wm/keymaps.jl: Rewrote all keymap initializations to
	use a single form instead of side-effecting the keymap after
	it's created. This lets the default value be known

	(custom-set-keymap): use an ugly hack to prevent the default
	value being destructively modified


	Added an extra deserialize/serialize pair when applying values
	from the UI. This is so that the customize-set function can do
	some kind of transformation at some point in the future..
	
	* sawfish/wm/custom.jl (make-custom-form): now requires an
	unserialized VALUE. It serializes it before creating the form

	* sawfish/wm/util/nokogiri.jl (nokogiri-apply-changes):
	deserialize the value from the UI before passing it to
	customize-set


	* sawfish/wm/util/keymap-diff.jl (diff-keymaps, patch-keymap):
	new file. Experimental code for keymap abuse

2001-04-11  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 8047 (SOLARIS: Setting Gnomecc Workspaces spin button
	to decrease no of workspaces fails.):

	* sawfish/wm/workspace.jl: set
	{first,last}-interesting-workspace to nil when the workspace
	configuration changes

	this isn't a great fix, but imho it's better than the current
	behaviour

2001-04-08  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/state/transient.jl (transient-frame-type):
	s/shaped/shaded/ to fix the bug where the decorate-transients
	option doesn't work for shaded windows

2001-04-05  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/ext/tooltips.jl (command-info): use the
	`command-documentation' function to get doc strings, not the
	`documentation' function (which no longer works)

2001-04-02  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/ext/window-history.jl: added special save and
	restore code for the `sticky' state (handles _both_ sticky
	states)

2001-03-24  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/state/maximize.jl (maximize-window,
	maximize-find-workarea): some bug fixes for multi-headed
	displays. Adapted from a patch by Florent Guillaume
	<florent.guillaume@mail.com>

2001-03-20  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 6971 (cancelling resizing a maximized window loses
	the maximimized status):

	* sawfish/wm/commands/move-resize.jl (do-move-resize): when
	calling after-move-hook or after-resize-hook pass a SUCCESSFUL
	keyword arg, whose value is true if the move or resize was
	successfully completed

	* sawfish/wm/state/maximize.jl (maximize-discard-move,
	maximize-discard-resize): these now have a SUCCESSFUL keyword
	parameter, they only do the discarding if it's true

2001-03-17  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/ext/tooltips.jl (tooltips-delay,
	tooltips-timeout-delay): minimum allowed value is now one not
	zero (zero timeouts don't work)

2001-03-14  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* version 0.38

2001-03-09  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/commands/grow-pack.jl: applied patch from Kai
	Großjohann <Kai.Grossjohann@CS.Uni-Dortmund.DE>:

	    `It makes growing work even for windows which have a
	    height/width increment.

	    With the old code, repeat-growing xterms didn't always work
	    right, since the old code only added 1 to the height/width,
	    and that was often not enough to overlap the next window
	    edge.  Now I'm adding height/width increment, and
	    preliminary testing indicates that this is working well.'

2001-03-06  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/focus.jl (scan-windows-for-bugs): disabled the
	code to beep and print warning messages if the click to focus
	keymap gets lost

	* sawfish/wm/state/gnome.jl (gnome-property-handler): fixed to
	work better when the window is on multiple workspaces

	* sawfish/wm/state/maximize.jl: don't add maximize-discard-move
	to the after-move-hook any longer

2001-02-28  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/state/gnome.jl (gnome-property-handler): new
	function, added to property-notify-hook. Currently just watches
	for _WIN_WORKSPACE changes, and responds by moving the window

	* sawfish/wm/workspace.jl
	(send-window-to-workspace-from-first): don't do any copying and
	moving if the FROM and TO workspaces are the same

	* sawfish/wm/commands/move-resize.jl (move-cursor-shape,
	resize-cursor-shape): default to the value of the
	default-cursor function

	* sawfish/wm/frames.jl (cursor-for-frame-part): don't use a
	special cursor in titles

2001-02-24  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/commands.jl (command-sequence): define
	`kill-client' command (using the x-kill-client function)

	Fixed off-by-one error when placing windows flush with the
	right or bottom of the screen

	* sawfish/wm/placement/smart.jl (sp-make-grid): don't subtract
	one from screen-width or screen-height
	(sp-prune-points): allow (<= X RANGE) instead of (< X RANGE)

2001-02-23  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/state/iconify.jl (window-sticky-p/workspace,
	make-window-sticky/workspace, make-window-unsticky/workspace,
	window-sticky-p/viewport, make-window-sticky/viewport,
	make-window-unsticky/viewport): new functions, used to
	implement the combined sticky functions. They're also exported

	* sawfish/wm/state/wm-spec.jl: uses the new /workspace or
	/viewport sticky functions throughout

	Fixed typo of _NET_WM_STATE_MAXIMIZED_HORIZ instead of HORZ

	Add update-client-list-hints to after-restacking-hook instead
	of workspace-state-change-hook

	(update-client-list-hints): added keyword arg
	ONLY-STACKING-LIST; reverse the result of the stacking-order
	function before storing it in the _NET_CLIENT_LIST_STACKING
	property

	(client-message-handler): use the display-window function to
	implement the _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW request. Added a
	_NET_WM_DESKTOP handler - handles making the window sticky or
	changing its workspace
	
2001-02-22  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/placement.jl (place-window): don't try to place
	windows with the fixed-position property

2001-02-14  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* version 0.37.2

	* sawfish/wm/commands/move-resize.jl (viable-move-resize-p):
	doh! fixed this properly now, was using the wrong variable to
	get the edge list

	* version 0.37.1

	* sawfish/wm/commands/move-resize.jl (viable-move-resize-p):
	fixed stupid typo in `region' and `border' modes (using
	direction instead of edge list)

2001-02-13  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* version 0.37

	* sawfish/wm/state/gnome.jl (gnome-window-class-hacks): 
	* sawfish/wm/state/wm-spec.jl (wm-class-hacks): 
	Look for `Panel/panel_window' instead of `Panel/panel'. This
	may not work well immediately, but it will with the forthcoming
	gnome-core release

	* sawfish/wm/ext/window-history.jl: new command line option
	`--window-history-file=FILE' to specify where to load and store
	the history information

	* sawfish/wm/user.jl (rc-files): new internal variable - the
	list of rc files to try, currently ~/.sawfishrc, ~/.sawfish/rc
	and ~/.sawmillrc

2001-02-10  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/ext/match-window.jl
	(match-window-grab-x-property): enclose grabbed regexp in
	`^...$' so that it only matches the exact string

2001-02-07  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/util/window-order.jl (on-viewport-change): only
	call window-order-focus-most-recent if in click-to-focus mode,
	not when not in enter-exit mode

2001-02-06  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/ext/match-window.jl (match-window-x-properties):
	added WM_WINDOW_ROLE to list of properties

	* sawfish/wm/state/transient.jl (transient-unmap-window): in
	sloppy focus mode avoid focusing on the desktop window just
	because the pointer is over it

2001-02-05  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/util/recolor-image.jl (make-lut): subtract
	mid-point from 255 not 256. Pointed out by Simon Budig
	<Simon.Budig@unix-ag.org>

2001-01-28  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	Work to fix bug 5758 (session management doesn't work in `don't
	automatically save' mode).

	Most of the credit goes to Timo Korvola
	<tkorvola@e.math.helsinki.fi> for working out what was wrong
	and providing the initial implementation

	* sawfish/wm/session/init.jl: lots of rewriting. The end result
	is that we never overwrite session files when saving data.
	Instead we use a unique prefix (the time in us in base 36) to
	the client id. (This is how XSM is supposed to work)

	* sawfish/wm/session/save.jl, sawfish/wm/session/load.jl
	(save-session, load-session): these functions now accept a
	filename argument instead of the client id

	* sawfish/wm.jl: check for --sm-prefix option, and pass it to
	sm-init when found

2001-01-27  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/state/configure.jl
	(configure-ignore-stacking-requests): new option. Controls
	whether stacking requests from windows are honoured or not. The
	window property `ignore-stacking-requests' has the same effect

	[ adapted from Matt Tucker <tuck@whistlingfish.net> ]

	* sawfish/wm/ext/match-window.jl (match-window-properties):
	added ignore-stacking-requests to the `Other' section

2001-01-25  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 5984 (locked-size-when-maximized is confusing):	

	* sawfish/wm/frames.jl (frame-part-classes): use calls to
	define-frame-class to populate this alist

	(cursor-for-frame-part): new function, creates functions to
	return the correct cursor. Uses frame-part-movable-p to see
	which cursor should be displayed 

	* sawfish/wm/state/maximize.jl (frame-part-movable-p): new
	function

	* sawfish/wm/state/maximize.jl (move-lock-when-maximized):
	moved this option here (from sawfish.wm.commands.move-resize)

	* sawfish/wm/commands/move-resize.jl
	(delete-unmovable-directions, delete-unresizable-edges): new
	functions

	(viable-move-resize-p): new function, tests if it's worth
	starting a move/resize (only if there's something that can be
	moved or resized)

2001-01-26  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/placement.jl (place-window-randomly): fixed bug
	where windows could be left off-screen. Problem was due to
	confusing right or bottom edges of the workarea with its width
	or height

2001-01-25  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/state/wm-spec.jl (init): the change to restore the
	selected desktop on restart introduced a bug, so I've changed
	it to not reselect the desktop until after the initialization
	process has finished (using the after-initialization-hook)

	* sawfish/wm/util/recolor-image.jl (make-image-recolorer*): new
	function, can recolour multiple channels at once (uses a common
	zero-channel, recolours based on whichever channel is non-zero
	for each pixel)

	(make-image-recolorer): now defined in terms of
	make-image-recolorer*

2001-01-23  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/state/wm-spec.jl (init): check for an old value of
	_NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP before overwriting it. If set, switch to
	that desktop. This fixes the annoying `desktop always reset to
	zero on restart' bug

2001-01-22  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/ext/auto-raise.jl (rw-on-focus, rw-out-focus):
	reverted the test for (eq mode 'normal). (See 2000-11-02 entry
	for reason.) This causes worse problems than it solves (e.g.
	switch desktops, M-TAB to a new window, but the old window gets
	raised)

2001-01-20  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* version 0.36

2001-01-19  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/user.jl (fallback-frame-style): changed this to
	`Crux' theme

	* sawfish/wm/frames.jl (frame-part-classes): added shade-button
	frame part class
	* sawfish/wm/keymaps.jl (shade-button-keymap): new keymap

	* sawfish/wm/util/recolor-image.jl (make-image-recolorer): new
	module, exports this function. A factory for creating functions
	that recolour images based on a white -> <color> -> black
	gradient. Abstracted this code out of the new `Crux' theme

	* sawfish/wm/gaol.jl (fully-safe-features): added
	sawfish.wm.util.recolor-image

2001-01-18  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/ext/hide-dialogs.jl: new module, hide dialog
	windows in groups that don't have the focus. Currently there's
	no way to enable this except by loading it by hand..

2001-01-15  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/util/gtkrc.jl (gtkrc-handle-client-msg): removed
	leftover debugging output

2001-01-08  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/util/gtkrc.jl (reload-gaol): new function, sets
	all the variables that are loaded into the gaol (since they
	don't update themselves automatically, doh!). Fixes bug 5505

	* sawfish/wm/commands/groups.jl (delete-group): added special
	case so that desktop windows don't get deleted

2001-01-07  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/ext/audio-events.jl (audio-events-alist): change
	"" doc string to nil (patch from Christian Marillat
	<marillat.christian@wanadoo.fr>)

2001-01-06  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/commands/groups.jl (delete-group): new command

	* sawfish/wm/keymaps.jl (close-button-keymap): bind
	`delete-group' to `S-Button1-Off'

2001-01-05  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* version 0.35

2001-01-05  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/state/shading.jl (shading-add-window): don't need
	to call shade-window, just set hide-client property when
	necessary

2001-01-04  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/workspace.jl: don't include hide-client in the
	call to add-swapped-properties

	* sawfish/wm/state/shading.jl (shading-after-swap-in): added to
	the after-workspace-swap-in-hook, updates the hide-client
	property to match the shaded property and reframes the window
	if necessary

	* sawfish/wm/swapper.jl (workspace-swap-in): before exiting,
	run after-workspace-swap-in-hook with two args (W SPACE)

	[ Last three changes fix bug 5179 (shaded state is fixed for
	all workspaces) ]

	* sawfish/wm/state/transient.jl (focus-windows-when-mapped):
	defaults to t; changed doc string to reflect the earlier change
	in semantics

	* sawfish/wm/placement.jl (place-window-mode): set to
	`top-left' by default now

	* sawfish/wm/placement/top-left.jl (windows-around): ignore
	windows that have yet to be placed

	* sawfish/wm/focus.jl (focus-click): before exiting, reinstall
	the click-to-focus-map if the window isn't actually focused

2001-01-03  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/state/transient.jl (transient-map-window): altered
	semantics of focus-windows-when-mapped option to only apply to
	non-transient windows (or transient windows whose parent is the
	root window)

	* sawfish/wm/user.jl: load sawfish.wm.state.wm-spec by default
	(instead of only if KDE2 is being used)

2000-12-31  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/windows.jl (window-supports-wm-protocol-p): new
	function, saves consing up a list just to call memq on it
	(delete-window-safely): use the new function

	* sawfish/wm/util/ping.jl (window-supports-ping-p): use
	window-supports-wm-protocol-p

	* sawfish/wm/util/stacking.jl (maybe-raise-window,
	maybe-lower-window): new functions. These introduce two new
	WM_PROTOCOLS: _SAWFISH_WM_RAISE_WINDOW and
	_SAWFISH_WM_LOWER_WINDOW.

	These are similar to WM_TAKE_FOCUS, in that if the window
	supports the protocol, it's up to it whether or not it raises
	(or lowers) the window in question. These functions should only
	be used where the user hasn't explicitly requested the
	restacking

	An example usage is an application that doesn't want its window
	to be raised due to a button-press event that initiates a drag
	operation

	* sawfish/wm/ext/auto-raise.jl, sawfish/wm/util/stacking.jl:
	use the maybe-raise-window function instead of raise-window*

2000-12-30  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/placement/off-center.jl: another new placement
	mode. This one places windows in the centre of the screen.
	However if doing so would fully cover another window, then try
	another position roughly in the centre

2000-12-22  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/placement/smart.jl (sp-cost-components): removed
	the pointer and focus locality components by default

	* sawfish/wm/placement/top-left.jl: new placement mode,
	staggers from top-left, filling along the diagonal. Supports
	resizing windows to fit, but this is currently disabled

	* sawfish/wm/menus.jl (menus-include-shortcuts): this option
	defaults to nil

	* sawfish/wm/commands/grow-pack.jl (gp-avoid-windows): ignore
	iconified windows

2000-12-20  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/state/transient.jl (transient-of-p,
	indirect-transient-of-p): added keyword arg ALLOW-ROOT which
	enables the (= transient-for ROOT) checking code

	(transient-map-window): pass `#:allow-root t' to transient-of-p

	* sawfish/wm/placement.jl (place-window-centered-on-parent): if
	no single known parent, check if the currently focused window
	is in the same group as the window being placed. If so, take it
	as the implicit parent while placing

	* sawfish/wm/state/transient.jl (transient-of-p): disabled the
	code that checks if (= transient-for ROOT), it causes havoc in
	too many places

2000-12-19  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/state/iconify.jl (iconify-window,
	uniconify-window): support `group' and `transients'
	[un]iconification modes better. Don't use a recursive method,
	instead identify all the windows to be changed, then do
	everything in one go. For `transients' mode, only change state
	of shared transients if they [will] have no visible parents
	left

	* sawfish/wm/commands/groups.jl (iconify-group,
	uniconify-group, iconify-transient-group,
	uniconify-transient-group): use [un]iconify-window to implement
	these (by temporarily binding the necessary special variables)

	[ Last two changes fix #5252 ]

	* sawfish/wm/util/keymap.jl (where-is,
	make-memoizing-where-is): use substitute-wm-modifier to avoid
	showing W- in results

	* sawfish/wm/util/decode-events.jl (substitute-wm-modifier):
	new function, given an event, replaces the W- bit by whatever
	it's actually assigned to

	* sawfish/wm/state/gnome.jl (gnome-client-message-handler):
	handle a _WIN_HINTS client message type, format is similar to
	_WIN_STATE message

	* sawfish/wm/state/gnome.jl (gnome-window-class-hacks): removed
	the hardcoding of the `avoid' property for the panel. (George
	Lebl asked me to)

2000-12-18  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/menus.jl (menus-include-shortcuts): new option,
	when set, include `shortcut' attributes in created menu
	descriptions. Adapted from Unai Uribarri <unaiur@telecable.es>

	* sawfish/wm/util/keymap.jl (make-memoizing-where-is): new
	function, when called repeatedly has better time complexity
	than multiple calls to where-is (since it builds a temporary
	hash table)

2000-12-10  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/util/stacking.jl (raise-window*, lower-window*,
	raise-lower-window*): added doc strings

	* sawfish/wm/gaol.jl (safe-functions): added font-ascent and
	font-descent

2000-12-09  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/util/display-wininfo.jl (event-handler): removed
	the code to fade iconified windows

	* sawfish/wm/commands/x-cycle.jl (cycle-warp-pointer): this is
	no longer in the `expert' user-level

2000-12-08  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	Random work to support KDE2 better:

	* sawfish/wm/user.jl: if there's a property on the root window
	matching `^_KDE_', load sawfish.wm.state.wm-spec module

	* sawfish/wm/state/wm-spec.jl: bug-fixes and hacks to make KDE2
	support a lot better

	* sawfish/wm/state/transient.jl (indirect-transient-of-p): test
	for windows that set WM_TRANSIENT_FOR to themselves! (broken
	KDE apps)

2000-12-06  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/user.jl: use safe-load when loading site-init and
	rep-defaults files

	* sawfish/wm/commands/viewport-extras.jl: new module, includes
	some viewport navigation commands sent to the mailing list by
	Dams Nadé <anvil@amin.unice.fr>

	* sawfish/wm/util/groups.jl (persistent-group-ids): use `nil'
	instead of `""' to denote a null doc string
	* sawfish/wm/workspace.jl (workspace-names): ditto

	* sawfish/wm/state/iconify.jl (window-iconifiable-p): new
	function, the old logic plus it checks for `never-iconify'
	property

	* sawfish/wm/state/maximize.jl (window-maximizable-p): check
	for `never-maximize' property

	* sawfish/wm/state/wm-spec.jl, sawfish/wm/state/gnome.jl: set
	never-iconify and never-maximize properties of panel/gmc-icon
	windows

	* sawfish/wm/menus.jl (window-ops-menu): set `insensitive'
	properties of iconify and maximize menus when appropriate

2000-12-04  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/frames.jl (frame-style-directory): check if the
	directory exists before returning the result. Fixes #4902

	* version 0.34

	* sawfish/wm/keymaps.jl (wm-modifier-value): moved to the
	`novice' user-level

2000-11-28  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/custom-defaults.jl: changed some bindings to use
	`W-' modifier

	* sawfish/wm/util/decode-events.jl (decode-modifier,
	encode-modifier): new functions
	(should-grab-button-event-p): groks the `W-' modifier

	* sawfish/wm/ext/match-window.jl (match-window-properties):
	removed ignore-when-cycling property (didn't I already do
	this?)

	* sawfish/wm/keymaps.jl: changed default bindings to use the
	new `W-' modifier, the customizable `WM' modifier

	* sawfish/wm/keymaps.jl (wm-modifier-value): new option. Has
	type `modifier-list'. Added [de]serialization for this type

	* sawfish/wm/customize.jl (customize-read-user-file): fixed for
	new format of custom-default-file

	* sawfish/wm/util/ping.jl (ping-window): fixed bug whereby
	CALLBACK would get called twice if the ping is ponged before
	the timer fires

	* sawfish/wm/state/gnome.jl (gnome-window-class-hacks): broke
	out the WM_CLASS based hacks for parts of the GNOME desktop.
	Also made panel windows and gmc icons unplacable (otherwise, if
	the ignore-program-position option is set the windows get
	placed by the wm, even though they really shouldn't be)

	* sawfish/wm/state/wm-spec.jl: added the unplacable panel hack
	here also

2000-11-27  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/state/wm-spec.jl: removed the evil hardcoded list
	of properties in update-client-state by a `get' method in each
	state function. Also added a PSEUDO keyword arg to
	define-wm-spec-window-state for properties that should not be
	set in the _NET_WM_STATE property

	* sawfish/wm/ext/window-history.jl: save and restore
	`maximized' state of windows. Fixes #4790

	* sawfish/wm/ext/window-history.jl (window-history-apply): when
	setting properties, check for `window-history-setter'
	properties - a function to call to set the property

	* sawfish/wm/ext/match-window.jl: added `maximized' pseudo
	property. Fixes #4808

	* sawfish/wm/util/display-wininfo.jl: new module, exports a
	single function to display a message with some user-relevant
	details of the window (currently icon and name)

	* sawfish/wm/commands/x-cycle.jl (cycle-show-window-icons): new
	option
	(cycle-display-message): if cycle-show-window-icons is set,
	use display-wininfo function
	(remove-message): new function

	The above two changes from a patch by Unai Uribarri
	<unaiur@telecable.es>, with minor changes. Fixes #4265

	* sawfish/wm/frames.jl, sawfish/wm/workspace.jl,
	sawfish/wm/ext/audio-events.jl, sawfish/wm/util/groups.jl:
	changed flags of some widgets

	* sawfish/wm/swapper.jl, sawfish/wm/stacking.jl,
	sawfish/wm/menus.jl, sawfish/wm/commands/x-cycle.jl,
	sawfish/wm/ext/tooltips.jl, sawfish/wm/ext/match-window.jl,
	sawfish/wm/ext/edge-flip.jl, sawfish/wm/gnome/match-window.jl, 
	sawfish/wm/placement/smart.jl, sawfish/wm/state/maximize.jl,
	sawfish/wm/theming/make-theme.jl, sawfish/wm/util/gtkrc.jl:
	Added some `(unused ...)' declarations to turn off some
	meaningless warnings (needs a recent cvs librep for this to
	actually work)

2000-11-26  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/util/ping.jl: new module, implements the
	_NET_WM_PING protocol of the new window manager spec. Exports
	functions `window-supports-ping-p' and `ping-window'. (This
	code is totally untested)

	* sawfish/wm/state/wm-spec.jl: added code to monitor
	_NET_WM_ICON_GEOMETRY; when present the `icon-position' window
	property is set from its value. Fixes #4245

2000-11-21  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/focus.jl: now that unfocusable windows don't
	contain the click-to-focus keymap, use the state-change-hook to
	be notified when the never-focus state changes

	* sawfish/wm/workspace.jl, sawfish/wm/ext/audio-events.jl,
	sawfish/wm/util/groups.jl: put titles of some list widgets into
	the actual title of the list, not above the list widget

	* sawfish/wm/ext/audio-events.jl (audio-events-alist): now in
	`intermediate' user-level

2000-11-20  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/stacking.jl (raise-window, lower-window,
	stack-window-above, stack-window-below, restack-window,
	window-on-top-p): use stacking-order instead of
	stacked-mapping-order. Otherwise strange things can happen when
	unmapped windows are present (e.g. fixes #4824 where raising a
	nautilus window with (eq user-raise-type 'groups) also raises
	the desktop window..)

	* sawfish/wm/viewport.jl (move-window-to-current-viewport,
	set-window-viewport): don't move sticky-viewport windows

	* sawfish/wm/animation/outline.jl (make-outline-animator): new
	exported function. Fixes #4816

	* sawfish/wm/focus.jl: removed all code to support the
	focus-click-through option on non-client windows (mfleming
	convinced me it was a bad idea, and it fixes a hard bug)

	* sawfish/wm/focus.jl (focus-within-click-event): new fluid,
	set to t when calling a command from within the click-to-focus
	event

	* sawfish/wm/commands/raise-commands.jl (replay-pointer):
	function to do the replaying, dependent on whether or not we're
	in the click-to-focus event or not

	* sawfish/wm/state/wm-spec.jl: support SKIP_PAGER state (linked
	to the `window-list-skip' property)

	(honour-client-state): set `no-history' property of panels

	(honour-client-state): fixed typo of _NET_WM_WINDOW_STATE
	instead of _NET_WM_STATE

	(update-workspace-hints): for sticky windows, set
	_NET_WM_DESKTOP to #xffffffff instead of deleting it

	(define-wm-spec-window-state): records the names of all
	registered states in `supported-states' variable
	(supported-state-p): new function

	(client-message-handler): deleted _NET_INSERT_DESKTOP and
	_NET_DELETE_DESKTOP messages, they're not in the spec anymore?
	Fixed paren bug in _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW message handler

2000-11-16  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/state/gnome.jl (gnome-honour-client-state): set
	the `no-history' property of panel windows

	* sawfish/wm/custom.jl: new defcustom option `:widget-flags'

	* sawfish/wm/util/nokogiri.jl (nokogiri-report-slot): pass
	widget-flags across

	* sawfish/wm/workspace.jl, sawfish/wm/frames.jl,
	sawfish/wm/ext/audio-events.jl, sawfish/wm/util/groups.jl:
	marked some list options with `(expand framed)' flags

	* sawfish/wm/state/mwm.jl (mwm-add-window): support the
	min/max/close options of the mwm function hints

	* sawfish/wm/state/iconify.jl: don't add minimize to the
	toggles menu

	* sawfish/wm/menus.jl: simplified the window-ops-menu, just
	have minimize/maximize/close at the top of the menu, with other
	stuff below

	* sawfish/wm/menus.jl (menu-preprocessor): labels can now be
	functions, they will be called (with any menu-args) to get the
	actual string

	* sawfish/wm/frames.jl (after-setting-default-frame): used as
	:after-set function of default-frame-style. Checks that the new
	frame style is available, signals an error otherwise

	* sawfish/wm/custom.jl (define-custom-setter, custom-setter):
	store these in a dedicated hash table

	(custom-set-symbol): function to catch exceptions while
	committing custom changes, then revert back to the old value if
	necessary (resignalling the exception)

	(custom-set-variable, custom-set-typed-variable): use
	custom-set-symbol instead of custom-set directly

	(custom-load): new function, parses and executes a custom file
	by hand
	(custom-eval): don't just call eval, deref the function and
	apply it to the arguments

	(custom-load-user-file): use custom-load instead of load

	* sawfish/wm.jl: use sawfish-locale-directory when calling
	bindtextdomain

	* sawfish/wm/misc.jl (call-with-error-handler): new function

	* sawfish/wm/windows.jl: fix typo in name of
	uniquify-window-name command

2000-11-15  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/menus.jl (window-ops-menu): renamed the `Delete'
	item as `Close'

	* sawfish/wm/menus.jl (window-ops-menu): deleted `Destroy' item

	* sawfish/wm/ext/window-history.jl (window-history-clear): new
	function and command

	* sawfish/wm/ext/window-history.jl
	(window-history-ignore-transients): new option, disables auto
	history saving for transient windows (t by default)

	* sawfish/wm/placement/smart.jl (sp-cost:overlap): changed the
	function calculating this to (exp (- (/ overlap (*
	(screen-width) (screen-height))))). Patch from Unai Uribarri
	<unaiur@telecable.es>

	* sawfish/wm/keymaps.jl (window-keymap): deleted C-M-Left and
	C-M-Right bindings (send window to previous/next workspace).
	They can be confusing when hit by mistake

	* sawfish/wm/ext/error-handler.jl: expanded this to stash all
	errors in a ring buffer. Functions `retrieve-errors' and
	`display-errors' to access this buffer. Also added an option
	error-destination controlling where error messages are
	displayed (stderr, screen, /dev/null)

	* sawfish/wm/defaults.jl: require sawfish.wm.ext.error-handler

	* sawfish/wm/util/window-order.jl (on-viewport-change): don't
	call window-order-focus-most-recent if using the `enter-exit'
	focus mode

2000-11-14  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/state/maximize.jl (unmaximize-window-1): added an
	optional arg BEFORE, a thunk to call immediately before doing
	the resize
	(unmaximize-window): use the new BEFORE param to ensure that
	the window's properties get updated before it's resized. This
	way the theme will get the correct values of window-maximized-p
	when it rebuilds the frame

	* sawfish/wm/util/window-order.jl (on-viewport-change):
	reinstated this function; this time it removes ordering
	information from all viewport-sticky windows in the current
	workspace/viewport pair

	* sawfish/wm/commands/grow-pack.jl (gp-avoid-windows): ignore
	unmapped windows

2000-11-13  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/ext/match-window.jl (match-window-properties):
	deleted obsolete ignore-when-cycling property

	* version 0.33.1

	* sawfish/wm/state/gnome.jl (gnome-honour-client-state): go
	back to setting `avoid' manually for panel windows

2000-11-13  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/ext/edge-flip.jl: import rep.io.timers

	* sawfish/wm/state/transient.jl (transient-map-window): fix
	stupid typo in `cond' statement breaking focus-on-map option
	(#4698). Patch from Unai Uribarri Rodríguez
	<unaiur@telecable.es>

2000-11-12  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/ext/beos-window-menu.jl: fixed the code that was
	supposed to add `unused' windows. It now also includes
	iconified windows (even if they wouldn't normally be in the
	menu)

	* sawfish/wm/ext/beos-window-menu.jl (make-label): abbreviate
	menu items the default amount (so that they match the parent
	items if they get moved up a level)

2000-11-10  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/focus.jl (focus-push-map, focus-pop-map): set the
	ignore-fp-keymap property of windows to t while they have the
	click-to-focus keymap. Fixes #4233

	* sawfish/wm/focus.jl: add a function to the
	after-initialization-hook to call focus-add-window on all
	windows (map-notify-hook doesn't get called for these windows)

2000-11-08  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* version 0.33

2000-11-08  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/state/transient.jl (transient-map-window): fix
	error when no window is focused

2000-11-06  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/focus.jl: add focus-add-window to the
	map-notify-hook not after-add-window-hook. When checking for
	the `click-to-focus windows unfocusable' bug, only check mapped
	windows, and use focus-push-map to recover, not custom hackery

	* sawfish/wm/state/transient.jl (transient-map-window): cleaned
	up control flow (removed unnecessary variable), and using
	transient-of-p instead of checking manually (this means that
	the transient-for = root-window convention is supported)

2000-11-03  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/state/maximize.jl: immediately before exiting
	unmaximize all maximized windows. But be careful not to reflect
	this change in their properties (either wm-local or in the X
	server). Fixes #4336

	* sawfish/wm/state/wm-spec.jl (wm-spec-init): changed
	_NET_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK properties to type 'WINDOW. Also set
	_NET_WM_NAME property on the identifying client window

2000-11-02  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/ext/auto-raise.jl (rw-on-focus, rw-out-focus):
	only do anything if (eq MODE 'normal); fixes #15526 in Red Hat
	bugzilla. Not totally sure that this doesn't break anything,
	but it's easily revertable if it does..

	* sawfish/wm/frames.jl (frame-class-removed-p): new function

	* sawfish/wm/state/maximize.jl (check-if-maximizable,
	property-notify): new functions, added to add-window-hook and
	property-notify-hook respectively. When WM_NORMAL_HINTS changes
	in any way, check if the window is maximizable or not; then
	hide (or reshow) the maximize button as necessary. Fixes #4260

2000-11-01  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm.jl: load sawfish.wm.state.maximize at startup,
	since it adds things to hooks

	* sawfish/wm/ext/edge-flip.jl (before-edge-flip-hook,
	after-edge-flip-hook): new hooks

	(before-flip, after-flip, edge-flip-while-moving): edge
	flipping while dragging windows now obeys the edge-flip-delay
	setting

2000-10-31  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/state/maximize.jl: added a function to the
	after-window-hook that checks for `queued-{vertical,horizontal}-
	maximize' properties on windows. When found the window is
	maximized. This gets around the problem of not being able to
	maximize a window before it's been framed

	* sawfish/wm/state/wm-spec.jl, sawfish/wm/state/gnome.jl: set
	queued maximize properties if a newly-created window needs to
	be maximize

	* sawfish/wm/state/gnome.jl: now understands
	WIN_HINTS_DO_NOT_COVER flag to be the same as the `avoid'
	property

2000-10-30  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/theming/make-theme-preview.jl: add the function
	that watches for preview windows to after-add-window-hook not
	before-add-window-hook to make sure that any given frame sticks

	* sawfish/wm/state/transient.jl (transient-unmap-window): when
	unmapping a transient, before deciding to focus on its parent,
	look for the most recently focused window in the same group.
	This may well be more intuitive in some circumstances

	* sawfish/wm/util/window-order.jl (window-order-most-recent):
	new keyword arg WINDOWS, a list of windows to restrict the
	returned value to

2000-10-29  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/placement/smart.jl (sp-make-grid): don't add root
	window points if they're already in the list; add (1-
	(screen-width)) etc, so that these points aren't chopped

	(sp-get-windows): new optional parameter PRED, a predicate
	function to use to select the windows to check for overlap.
	Also included a fix from David Bustos <bustos@its.caltech.edu>
	to fix a typo in the window-mapped-p check

	(sp-do-placement): new keyword arg #:window-filter, passed to
	sp-get-windows

	(place-window-best-fit-group): new placement mode
	`best-fit-group'. Same as `best-fit', except that windows not
	in the same group as the window being placed aren't included in
	the overlap calculation (useful for transients)

2000-10-28  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/custom-defaults.jl: added some more settings;
	hopefully they give a better default configuration..

	* sawfish/wm/custom.jl: added command line option
	`--custom-file' to set the value of custom-user-file

2000-10-26  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/workspace.jl, sawfish/wm/commands/describe.jl,
	sawfish/wm/ext/3d-hack.jl: made some commands #:user-level
	expert

	* sawfish/wm/util/nokogiri.jl (nokogiri-report-commands): fixed
	and/or typo

	* sawfish/wm/util/groups.jl (persistent-group-ids): changed
	type of this option from `(list string)' to `(list symbol)' as
	it should have been

2000-10-25  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/focus.jl (focus-click): the logic to ungrab the
	pointer in non-click-through mode was reversed (i.e. broken)

	* sawfish/wm/workspace.jl (ws-add-window): set swapped-in
	property of sticky windows, otherwise they don't get swapped
	out the first time a new workspace is selected

2000-10-24  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/swapper.jl (workspace-swap-out,
	workspace-swap-in): don't swap non-plist attributes of sticky
	windows (this means that sticky geometry is fixed, probably as
	it should be)

	* sawfish/wm/util/window-order.jl: made the `order' property
	workspace-local once more (there's a remark earlier in this
	ChangeLog about that being non-intuitive, but it's better that
	way for sticky windows)
	(window-order-pop-low-sticky-windows): removed this hack, it's
	not required now order is workspace-local

	* sawfish/wm/workspace.jl (select-workspace): swap-in data for
	all sticky windows as well as normal windows in the new
	workspace

	* sawfish/wm/ext/match-window.jl: fixed :require fields to use
	sawfish.wm.ext.match-window instead of just match-window

	* sawfish/wm/focus.jl (focus-enter-fun, focus-leave-fun):
	accept an extra MODE parameter		
	(enter-exit mode): pointer-leave events only cause focus to be
	jettisoned if (eq MODE 'normal)

	* sawfish/wm/focus.jl (focus-click): call forget-button-press
	after either replaying or ungrabbing pointer events (otherwise
	following events are marked as click2, which won't trigger the
	bindings in the click-to-focus-map)

	* sawfish/wm/state/gnome.jl (gnome-honour-client-state):
	magically set never-focus property of gmc-desktop-icon windows

2000-10-23  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/focus.jl: added a hack to the idle-hook to check
	that unfocused click-to-focus windows have the correct keymap
	installed (it would be better to fix the cause not the
	symptoms, but until then..)

2000-10-22  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/placement.jl (place-window-interactively): after
	calling accept-x-input, check that the window wasn't destroyed
	before placing the window.. (patch from merlin)

	* sawfish/wm/state/maximize.jl (maximize-find-workarea): new
	parameter #:head

	Integrated a patch from Geoff Reedy <vader21@imsa.edu> to
	support Xinerama better

	* sawfish/wm/commands/x-cycle.jl (cycle-display-message): put
	the message on the head associated with the window

	* sawfish/wm/placement.jl (place-window-under-pointer): centre
	on the head under the pointer, not the current head

	* sawfish/wm/misc.jl (pointer-head): new function, returns the
	head that the pointer is on

2000-10-20  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* sawfish/wm/util/nokogiri.jl (nokogiri-report-commands): use
	keys to pass back type and user-level of commands that have
	them

	* sawfish/wm/ext/shade-hover.jl (shade-hover-before): check for
	windowp before window-get'ing

	* sawfish/wm/keymaps.jl: use user-customizable raise commands
	by default

	* sawfish/wm/commands/x-cycle.jl,
	sawfish/wm/commands/move-resize.jl,
	sawfish/wm/commands/grow-pack.jl, sawfish/wm/ext/auto-raise.jl,
	sawfish/wm/state/shading.jl, sawfish/wm/state/maximize.jl,
	sawfish/wm/state/configure.jl,
	sawfish/wm/util/display-window.jl: use raise-window* instead of
	raise-window

	* sawfish/wm/util/stacking.jl (raise-window*, lower-window*,
	raise-lower-window*): new functions, they choose a raise mode
	based on the customization option user-raise-type

	* sawfish/wm/stacking.jl, sawfish/wm/commands/groups.jl,
	sawfish/wm/state/transient.jl: put raise/lower commands at
	'expert level

	* sawfish/wm/commands/raise-commands.jl: new command
	raise-and-pass-through-click, uses user's preferred raise mode

	* sawfish/wm/stacking.jl: renamed raise-window, lower-window,
	and raise-lower-window as raise-single-window, etc..

	* sawfish/wm/commands.jl (apply-command-keys): abstracted
	command #!key args here. New parameter #:user-level
	(command-type, command-user-level): new functions

2000-10-19  John Harper  <jsh@eazel.com>

	* version 0.32

	* sawfish/wm/windows.jl (mark-window-as-desktop): new function
	* sawfish/wm/state/gnome.jl (gnome-honour-client-state): use
	mark-window-as-desktop

	* sawfish/wm/commands/x-cycle.jl: included patch from merlin
	for a different reverse-cycling implementation, with minor
	cleanups

2000-10-18  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish/wm/windows.jl: added window-urgent-p to the gaol

	* sawfish/wm/focus.jl (focus-click): in non-click-through mode,
	ungrab the pointer so that the release event can't trigger
	window decorations

	* sawfish/wm/ext/match-window.jl (match-window-properties):
	`dimensions' property was called `size' by mistake

2000-10-14  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish/wm/placement/smart.jl: export the various sp-cost:
	functions

2000-10-12  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish/wm/ext/shade-hover.jl: miscellaneous improvements
	inspired by a patch to the mailing list from Eli Barzilay
	<eli@barzilay.org>. Unshading a hovered window doesn't flicker,
	reshade the window if it loses focus

	* sawfish/wm/commands.jl (call-command): allow pre-command-hook
	to modify this-command and current-prefix-arg. If it sets
	this-command to false then the command is ignored

2000-10-11  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish/wm/stacking.jl (apply-group-order): swap do for let

	* sawfish/wm/commands/x-cycle.jl (cycle-prefix): match `Foo -
	...' as well as `Foo: ...'

2000-10-09  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish/wm/stacking.jl (raise-windows, lower-windows):
	rewritten to be more intelligent. These now search for the
	required stacking order of the windows then restack the windows
	in a single pass such that the minimum number of expose events
	are generated on the windows.

	[ Rob Hodges <s323140@student.uq.edu.au> found the algorithm
	and made the initial implementation of raise-windows. I
	translated it to tail-recursive iteration and implemented
	lower-windows along the same lines ]

	* sawfish/wm/state/transient.jl (transient-of-p): only apply
	the `(= WM_TRANSIENT_FOR Root) => transient for whole group'
	rule to non-transient windows
	(transient-children): new function

	* sawfish/wm/commands/x-cycle.jl: added ::doc: style embedded
	doc strings for the cycle commands

	* sawfish/wm/state/maximize.jl (window-maximizable-p,
	maximize-truncate-dims): fixed some bugs introduced by quoted
	nil no longer being boolean false

	* sawfish/wm/commands/x-cycle.jl (cycle-reverse-event): deleted
	(define-cycle-command): new function, used to create a pair of
	commands for cycling backwards and forwards through a given
	list of windows
	(cycle-begin): renamed from cycle-windows; search global-keymap
	for bindings of the command that cycles in the opposite
	direction to the currently executing command

	* sawfish/wm/state/gnome.jl (gnome-honour-client-state):
	SKIP_FOCUS no longer sets never-focus and ignored properties,
	instead it just sets cycle-skip. SKIP_FOCUS defining whether
	the window is focusable or not wasn't very clever, WM_HINTS
	defines that

	Added a `window-list-skip' property to allow windows to be
	taken out of the windows menu

	* sawfish/wm/state/ignored.jl (toggle-window-list-skip): new
	function / command

	* sawfish/wm/state/gnome.jl (gnome-honour-client-state):
	if SKIP_WINLIST set, then set window-list-skip property
	(gnome-set-client-hints): new function, updates _WIN_HINTS when
	the user changes something. Currently just maps
	window-list-skip to SKIP_WINLIST

	* sawfish/wm/gnome/match-window.jl: no longer handles
	SKIP_WINLIST, that's now tied to the window-list-skip property

	* sawfish/wm/ext/window-history.jl (window-history-states):
	added window-list-skip property

	* sawfish/wm/ext/old-window-menu.jl,
	sawfish/wm/ext/beos-window-menu.jl: check for window-list-skip
	property

	* sawfish/wm/ext/match-window.jl (match-window-properties):
	added cycle-skip and window-list-skip properties

	* sawfish/wm/commands/gnome.jl: implemented skip-winlist
	commands in terms of window-list-skip property and
	toggle-window-list-skip function

2000-10-08  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish/wm/user.jl: catch and print errors while calling
	custom-load-user-file

	* sawfish/wm/ext/match-window.jl (match-window): ensure that
	each property is a symbol before calling get-prop

	* sawfish/wm/ext/auto-raise.jl (rw-on-focus): minimum timeout
	is now one millisecond, not zero

	* sawfish/wm/ext/auto-raise.jl (rw-on-focus): in the timer
	callback, if disable-auto-raise is set, reset the timer for
	another try later

2000-10-07  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish/wm/ext/beos-window-menu.jl (group-name): only look
	for window-class of an integer id if it's positive

2000-10-05  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish/wm/windows.jl (window-in-cycle-p): use
	window-really-wants-input-p instead of just checking
	'never-focus property

	* sawfish/wm/focus.jl (focus-click): on exit, if the window
	isn't focused push the click-to-focus-map back onto the window

	* sawfish/wm/windows.jl (ignore-window-input-hint): defaults to
	false now that window-accepts-input-p defaults to true if no
	WM_HINTS property

2000-10-03  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish/wm/user.jl: fix typo when loading the `defaults' file
	(patch from Ronald Wahl
	<ronald.wahl@informatik.tu-chemnitz.de>)

	* sawfish/wm/viewport.jl: fix command spec's of move-window-foo
	commands (patch from Yoshiki Hayashi <yoshiki@xemacs.org>)

2000-09-29  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish/wm/state/wm-spec.jl: fixed some minor bugs

	(wm-spec-honour-client-state): treat _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE as a
	vector of atoms, the first atom we have a type definition for
	is the one we use

	(define-wm-spec-window-type, define-wm-spec-window-type): new
	functions

2000-09-26  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish/wm/commands/x-cycle.jl: don't pass EVENT parameter
	between commands. Export cycle-next function

	* sawfish/wm/commands/x-cycle.jl: the reverse key is now used
	to cycle one step `backwards'. The cycle-windows function now
	has a keyword arg STEP defining the direction (and magnitude)
	of cycle steps

	* sawfish/wm/util/decode-events.jl (modifier-keysym-p): new
	function

	* sawfish/wm/commands/x-cycle.jl (cycle-windows): add the
	modifiers of the invoking event to the cycle-reverse-event when
	creating its binding

	* sawfish/wm/util/decode-events.jl (decode-event): use a `do'
	statement instead of while and setq

2000-09-25  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish/wm/commands/x-cycle.jl (cycle-reverse-event): new
	option, the name of the event that causes cycling to reverse
	direction. (My rationale is that this is less fiddly to use
	than, e.g., making M-S-TAB go backwards, and also is cleaner to
	implement)

	* sawfish/wm/misc.jl (current-head): fall back to checking the
	pointer position if no head is found for the window

	* sawfish/wm/windows.jl, sawfish/wm/frames.jl,
	sawfish/wm/ext/shade-hover.jl: added some :tooltip's

	* sawfish/wm/custom.jl (defcustom): new keyword `:tooltip
	STRING'. Embed it into the doc string (following a `\n\n'
	marker)

2000-09-23  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish/wm/ext/3d-hack.jl: export 3d-make-cube and
	3d-make-saw

2000-09-22  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	(patch from Christian Marillat <marillat.christian@wanadoo.fr>)

2000-09-20  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* version 0.31

2000-09-19  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish/wm/user.jl: set *user-structure* to 'user
	* sawfish/wm.jl: set *user-structure* (temporarily) to
	'sawfish.wm, don't set *root-structure* (it's been removed)

	* sawfish/wm/util/window-order.jl (on-viewport-change): use the
	same hack for sticky windows used when changing workspaces

2000-09-17  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish/wm/ext/3d-hack.jl (3d-hack): check if current-event
	returns something before passing it to decode-event

	* sawfish/wm/focus.jl (focus-click): only try to pass through
	the click (or whatever) if current-event returns something

2000-09-14  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish/wm/state/ignored.jl (toggle-window-cycle-skip): new
	command, also added to the toggle menu

	* sawfish/wm/ext/window-history.jl,
	sawfish/wm/ext/match-window.jl: include the cycle-skip property

	* sawfish/wm/commands/cycle.jl, sawfish/wm/commands/x-cycle.jl:
	use window-in-cycle-p to decide which windows to include

	* sawfish/wm/windows.jl (window-in-cycle-p): new function

	[ adapted from a patch from Dave Dribin <yhdrib@yahoo.com> ]

2000-09-13  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish/wm/ext/tooltips.jl (display-tooltip): the TEXT
	argument may now be a function (which should produce a string
	when called)

	* sawfish/wm/ext/tooltips.jl (display-tooltip-after-delay): new
	exported function

2000-09-11  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish/wm/workspace.jl, sawfish/wm/windows.jl,
	sawfish/wm/user.jl, sawfish/wm/server.jl, sawfish/wm/misc.jl,

	No need to explicitly open `rep.io.streams' anymore

2000-09-10  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish/wm/util/gtkrc.jl (gtkrc-get-style): ungrab the X
	server before running `gtk-style'. Otherwise it may not be able
	to connect

	* sawfish/wm/misc.jl (call-with-server-ungrabbed): new function

2000-09-08  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	rep.io.files, rep.io.file-handlers)

2000-09-07  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish/wm/user.jl (safe-load): convenience function to catch
	errors from `load'. Used when loading user scripts

	* sawfish/wm/ext/old-window-menu.jl (old-window-menu): fixed
	the `do' iteration parameters

	* sawfish/wm/customize.jl, sawfish/wm/custom.jl: added module
	aliases

	* sawfish/wm/menus.jl: 
	* sawfish/wm/state/iconify.jl: moved the `Iconify' window menu
	item to the `Toggle' submenu, and called it `Minimized'

	* sawfish/wm/workspace.jl, sawfish/wm/frames.jl: 
	* sawfish/wm/ext/old-window-menu.jl,
	sawfish/wm/ext/beos-window-menu.jl: 
	* sawfish/wm/util/groups.jl: create radio-button menu-items
	where appropriate

	* sawfish/wm/ext/beos-window-menu.jl
	(beos-window-menu-simplifies): new option, when t singleton
	submenus are lifted to replace their parent item

	* sawfish/wm/menus.jl (add-window-menu-toggle): new function,
	adds items to the `Toggle' submenu of the window-ops-menu
	(menu-preprocessor): menu items may be dotted to an alist of
	options (sawfish-menu currently supports `(check . STATE)')
	(menu-args): fluid providing arg-list for functions called
	while preprocessing menus
	(popup-window-menu): now takes a window as its sole arg, then
	sets menu-args to the singleton list containing this value

	* sawfish/wm/frames.jl, workspace.jl: 
	* sawfish/wm/ext/old-window-menu.jl,
	sawfish/wm/ext/beos-window-menu.jl: 
	* sawfish/wm/util/groups.jl: use check-items where appropriate
	when creating menus

	* sawfish/wm/state/shading.jl, sawfish/wm/state/ignored.jl,
	sawfish/wm/state/iconify.jl, sawfish/wm/state/gnome.jl: add
	window-menu toggle items

	* sawfish/wm/state/iconify.jl (window-iconified-p,

2000-09-06  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish/wm/window-anim.jl, sawfish/wm/animation/outline.jl:
	added structure aliases

	* sawfish/wm/animation/outline.jl (anim-outline-entry): check
	the 'icon-position property of the window before looking at
	anim-outline-icon-coords

	* sawfish/wm/custom.jl (custom-set-variable,
	custom-set-typed-variable): use user-require to load :require'd
	modules (in case they're bare code)

	* sawfish/wm/misc.jl (user-require): new function

2000-09-04  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish/wm/commands.jl (define-command): new keyword args DOC
	and DOC-KEY
	(command-documentation): new function, a bit of a kludge

2000-09-03  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish/wm/misc.jl (quote-menu-item): function to translate
	`_' to `__' in menu items (to avoid introducing unintended
	keyboard accelerators)

	* sawfish/wm/workspace.jl, sawfish/wm/frames.jl,
	sawfish/wm/ext/old-window-menu.jl,
	sawfish/wm/ext/beos-window-menu.jl, sawfish/wm/util/groups.jl:
	use quote-menu-item when creating menus

	* sawfish/wm/commands/describe.jl (describe-symbol): include
	null STRUCTURE arg in call to `documentation'

	* sawfish/wm/gaol.jl: added some more known-to-be-safe modules,
	export define-gaol-structure

2000-09-02  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish/wm/frames.jl (load-frame-style): name each gaol
	containing a theme as `themes.FOO' for a theme called FOO. This
	allows the theme's definitions to be inspected using the repl

	* sawfish/wm/util/nokogiri.jl (nokogiri-report-slot,
	nokogiri-report-group): use actual keywords in the results

2000-09-01  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish/wm/gnome/integration.jl: when adding to the `Help'
	menu, add an `About GNOME' item

	* sawfish/wm/menus.jl (root-menu): add an `About Sawfish' item

	* sawfish/wm/commands/help.jl (help:about): new command,
	launches the new `sawfish-about' script

	* sawfish/wm/commands/gnome.jl (gnome-about): new command,
	launches the `gnome-about' program

	* sawfish/wm/workspace.jl, sawfish/wm/util/groups.jl: tweaked a
	few doc strings

	* sawfish/wm/defaults.jl: aliased to sawmill-defaults

	* sawfish/wm/keymaps.jl (pointer-motion-threshold): declare
	this built-in customization option

2000-08-31  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish/wm/menus.jl: action parts of menu items may now be
	arbitrary lisp objects, instead of just those with a read
	syntax. This is achieved by using a hash table to map
	non-symbol objects to integer ``nicknames'' before passing the
	menu structure to the helper process. When a nickname comes
	back as the result, dereference the table to find the actual
	object. The reason for this is to allow menu items to contain
	closures, avoiding the gratuitous use of `eval' that was
	happening

	* sawfish/wm/ext/old-window-menu.jl,
	sawfish/wm/ext/beos-window-menu.jl, sawfish/wm/workspace.jl,
	sawfish/wm/frames.jl, sawfish/wm/util/groups.jl: use closures
	instead of bare code in menu items

2000-08-30  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	Some work to help the desktop-in-a-window approach work
	properly, as used by nautilus:

	* sawfish/wm/focus.jl: use desktop-window-p to recognize
	root/desktop windows. Make focusing work logically for desktop
	windows

	* sawfish/wm/windows.jl (desktop-window-p): new function, true
	if arg is 'root or a window with 'desktop property set

	optional arg UNADJUST, passed to adjust-position-for-gravity
	(place-window): if 'placed property is set, treat it like a
	user-specified position
	(unplace-window): new function added to remove-window-hook to
	undo gravity compensation

	* sawfish/wm/windows.jl (adjust-position-for-gravity): new

	opposite directions to normal

	[ these last two changes are adapted from E. Jay Berkenbilt
	<ejb@ql.org> ]

	* sawfish/wm/windows.jl (window-gravity): new function

	* sawfish/wm/state/maximize.jl (do-horizontal, do-vertical):
	fixed for non-zero current-head offsets

	* sawfish/wm/state/maximize.jl (window-unmaximized-position,
	window-unmaximized-dimensions): new functions, unused yet

	* sawfish/wm/util/edges.jl (get-visible-window-edges): removed
	`#:include-root' keyword, added `#:include-heads LIST-OR-t' and
	`#:include-screen t' giving more control over what gets added

	Changed all callers.

2000-08-26  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish/wm/workspace.jl: some renaming, ws-move-window ->
	move-window-to-workspace, ws-copy-window ->
	copy-window-to-workspace, ws-insert-workspace -> insert
	workspace, ws-move-workspace -> move-workspace (and exported),
	ws-remove-workspace -> move-workspace
	(insert-workspace): this command renamed as
	insert-workspace-after

	Updated all callers

	* sawfish/wm/viewport.jl (select-workspace-and-viewport): new
	function

	exported

2000-08-14  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish/wm/gaol.jl (safe-functions): added
	make-image-from-x-drawable

	* sawfish/wm/state/configure.jl (configure-request-handler): be
	ICCCM compliant when handling move requests -- honour the
	gravity if given, or default to NorthWest. Previously was
	always doing the equivalent of Static gravity (has this broken
	[m]any apps?)

2000-08-13  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish/wm/server.jl: server now reliably communicates errors
	back to the client (as `(signal 'remote-sawfish (list DATA))'
	where DATA is a string). Also renamed the sockets and X
	properties. The X protocol now includes a version number

2000-08-11  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish/wm/windows.jl (adjust-position-for-gravity): new
	function (abstracted from adjust-window-for-gravity)

	* sawfish/wm/commands.jl (function-spec): interactive spec in
	bytecode subr is now 5th element, not 6th

2000-08-08  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish/wm/ext/match-window.jl (safe-string-match): wrapper
	for string-match that catches and prints regexp errors

2000-08-03  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawfish/wm/custom.jl (custom-set-variable,
	custom-set-typed-variable): convert values which are the symbol
	`nil' to boolean false (let's hope nothing actually uses the
	symbol `nil'!)

	* sawfish/wm.jl, sawfish/wm/user.jl, sawfish/wm/defaults.jl:
	user module is now called `user', not `sawfish.wm.user'

	* sawfish/wm/customize.jl (customize-args): deleted this
	variable

2000-07-28  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	raise option is put at expert user-level

2000-07-27  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	Non-trivial changes to modularize sawfish. Instead of one
	unmaintainably huge namespace, each file gets its own module.
	Use sawfish.wm. hierarchy for modules that only apply to the
	wm. Other modules under sawfish. will appear soon. Modules can
	be imported separately, or `sawfish.wm' can be imported to get
	all core definitions

	* sawfish/wm.jl: does initialization and creates the sawfish.wm
	structure

	* sawfish/wm/commands.jl: all command handling is now written
	in Lisp. Fully compatible except for how commands are defined.
	Since we have no unified namespace, the mapping from names ->
	command definitions is maintained separately. define-command
	and autoload-command add entries to this mapping.
	define-command takes a name and a function, and optionally an
	interactive spec and a custom-type spec. The old style of
	defining commands still works, but only in the user module

	* x-cycle.jl, workspace.jl, wm-spec.jl, with-output.jl,
	window-outline.jl, window-order.jl, window-history.jl,
	window-anim.jl, viewport.jl, viewport-linear.jl, transient.jl,
	tooltips.jl, stagger-placement.jl, stacking.jl,
	smart-placement.jl, sm-save.jl, sm-load.jl, sm-init.jl,
	sm-common.jl, slide-window.jl, size-window.jl, shading.jl,
	shade-hover.jl, server.jl, select-window.jl, sawmill.jl,
	sawmill-gaol.jl, sawmill-defaults.jl, rects.jl,
	raise-commands.jl, prompt.jl, prompt-wm.jl, prompt-extras.jl,

	configure.jl, compat.jl, beos-window-menu.jl, autoload.jl,
	auto-raise.jl, audio-events.jl, anim-outline.jl, 3d-hack.jl:

	Moved (and maybe renamed) these files under sawfish.wm module
	hierarchy (also made most into modules)

2000-07-24  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* version 0.30.3

2000-07-23  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawmill.jl: don't require 'define. Also, only load "environ"
	when (< rep-interface-id 10) (cvs rep correctly autoloads this
	from a different location)

	* custom.jl (custom-add-to-group): don't require 'sort, it's
	not necessary and fails in cvs rep

	* window-outline.jl (draw-box-outline): ensure numbers are
	exact after rounding

	* anim-outline.jl (anim-outline-run): use integer arithmetic

	* stacking.jl (make-constraint): check for 'transients-above
	property on the window, else use global value
	* match-window.jl (match-window-properties): added
	'transients-above property

2000-07-19  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* shading.jl (shading-add-window): reinstate code to set
	'shaded property to nil before calling shade-window

	* keymaps.jl (custom-set-keymap): don't pass REQ arg to
	custom-set, just ignore it

	* custom.jl (custom-set): removed REQ parameter, has to be
	conditional on the value of the option
	(custom-set-variable, custom-set-typed-variable): if both REQ
	and VALUE are non-nil, require REQ. Make SYMBOL special before
	setting it

2000-07-18  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* custom.jl (custom-convert): fixed some stupid bugs when
	recursing into `list', `pair' and `and' types

2000-07-17  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* gnome-menu.jl: require 'menus when compiling (otherwise when
	setting apps-menu, don't know that it's special)

2000-07-16  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* wm-spec.jl: set 'fixed-position and 'never-focus properties
	of TYPE_DESKTOP windows

	* configure.jl: renamed the 'fixed-position property as
	'client-set-position. Changed all users

	* gnome.jl: support FIXED_POSITION hint, sets the
	'fixed-position property

	* move-resize.jl, slide-window.jl: when 'fixed-position is set,
	don't allow the window to be moved

	* workspace.jl: add 'fixed-position to those saved with the
	session data

2000-07-14  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* version 0.30.2

2000-07-13  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	Work to correct the problem that defcustom's with secondary
	types that need converting to-from strings weren't being
	converted, since only the outer type was being looked at:

	* custom.jl (custom-serialize, custom-deserialize,
	define-custom-serializer, define-custom-deserializer):
	functions to do deep conversions across (type, value) pairs

	(custom-set-typed-variable): similar to custom-set-variable,
	but with an extra arg, the type of the variable. This will
	slowly replace c-s-v in `custom' files. The type allows the
	conversion to work even if the variable has not yet been
	defined

	(variable-type): new function

	(custom-set-color, custom-set-font): removed, just conversion
	functions now. Compatibility functions in compat.jl

	* customize.jl (customize-set): emitted forms call
	custom-set-typed-variable not custom-set-variable and include
	type of variable (unless variable has a custom-set property)

	* nokogiri-sawfish.jl (nokogiri-report-slot): serialize the
	value to something that's printable (unless it has a custom-get
	property)

2000-07-13  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* match-window.jl: removed unused group-widget definition

	* wm-spec.jl, gnome.jl: use ws-set-window-workspaces instead of
	window-add-to-workspaces when honouring _WIN_WORKSPACE and
	_NET_WM_DESKTOP properties

	* gnome-int.jl: only redefine xterm-program if it's not been
	customized

2000-07-12  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* menus.jl (popup-menu): when writing the menu spec across the
	pipe, format it to a string, then write that. This only does a
	single system call

	* custom.jl (custom-set): new function, wraps a thunk to do the
	actual variable setting in the necessary pre- and post-fix
	code. Also sets a property 'custom-user-value on all variables
	that have been customized
	(variable-customized-p): new function
	(custom-set-variable): now in terms of custom-set

	* keymaps.jl (custom-set-keymap): now in terms of custom-set

	* viewport.jl (move-window-to-viewport): remember to correct
	for 1.. to vs 0.. indexing

	* transient.jl (transient-of-p): if WM_TRANSIENT_FOR is set to
	the root window, only compare group ids if non-nil
	(transient-parents, transient-group): ignore unmapped windows

2000-07-11  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* menus.jl (popup-menu): catch errors and unset menu-active

	* x-cycle.jl, workspace.jl, window-order.jl, viewport.jl,
	transient.jl, stacking.jl, smart-placement.jl, sm-save.jl,
	sm-load.jl, sawmill-gaol.jl, place-window.jl, grow-pack.jl,
	group-funs.jl, gnome.jl, frames.jl, edges.jl: replace `(mapc
	foo (managed-windows))' by `(map-windows foo)', and similar
	for filter-windows variants

	* functions.jl (map-windows): deleted, now a C function
	(get-window-by-name, get-window-by-name-re): deleted optional
	LST parameters; use filter-windows

	Cleaned up frame style and window type management:

	* frames.jl (define-frame-type-mapper): used to register a
	function that maps (WINDOW FRAME-TYPE) -> FRAME-TYPE. Used by
	find-frame-type-definition to factor window state into the type
	asked for from the theme

	(reframe-window): reframes a window, according to its current
	'type and 'frame-style properties

	(set-frame-style): sets 'frame-style property and acts on it
	(set-window-type): sets 'type property and acts on it

	(window-type): removed junk to handle decorate-transients
	option. Window type is _never_ changed for window state

	(set-window-frame-style, set-frame-for-window,
	reframe-one-window): deleted

	* shading.jl: don't mess with 'type property any more. But
	register a frame type mapper to handle conversion to shaded
	frames when 'shaded property is set

	* transient.jl: register a frame type mapper to handle
	decorate-transients option

	* workspace.jl, wm-spec.jl, window-history.jl, sawmill.jl,
	sawmill-gaol.jl, open-look.jl, mwm.jl, match-window.jl,
	ignore-window.jl, groups.jl: updated all users of the changed
	window frame & type interfaces

	[ amongst other things, these changes make changing the type of
	a window while it's shaded work correctly ]

2000-07-10  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* keymap.jl (quote-event): new implementation that uses event
	replaying to forward the events, so that it works with clients
	that don't accept synthesized events. Adapted from code posted
	to the mailing list by Timo Korvola in March (but without the
	complexity of also grabbing the pointer)

	* x-cycle.jl (cycle-windows): grab the keyboard synchronously,
	then if the M-TAB sequence is terminated by a non-release event
	that doesn't have a wm binding, replay it to the focused client
	window. Also, when calling any tail commands, ensure that
	current-event-window returns the newly-focused window

2000-07-09  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* version 0.30

2000-07-08  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* functions.jl (command-sequence): new command, allows the
	bindings ui to bind _sequences_ of commands to a single event

	uniconify-transient-group): new commands

	* workspace.jl, custom.jl, audio-events.jl: translate some
	strings in defcustom types

	* custom.jl (custom-option-alist): added `:type*' key, similar
	to `:type' but value isn't quoted

2000-07-05  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* stacking.jl (stacking-constraint:transients-above-parent):
	handle transients with more than one parent window
	(raise-windows, lower-windows): map across the list of windows
	twice to ensure that the optimum layout is found

	* transient.jl (transient-of-p, transient-parents): new
	functions. All these functions now understand the convention of
	setting WM_TRANSIENT_FOR to the root window to denote that the
	window is a transient for the whole group

	* sawmill.jl: load-all "autoload" not "autoload.jl"

	* workspace.jl, viewport.jl (workspace-geometry): new
	defcustom, replaces preallocated-workspaces and
	viewport-dimensions (which are now just defvars)

	* customize.jl (customize-read-user-file): delete items whose
	`custom-obsolete' property is set

	* compat.jl: set some custom-obsolete properties

2000-07-03  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* move-resize.jl: use constrain-dimension-to-hints instead of
	local hack

	* functions.jl (constrain-dimension-to-hints): new function,
	implements the size hints checking correctly (I was using
	base-size instead of min-size in some places)

	* stacking.jl (transients-above): stack above parents by
	default

	* keymaps.jl: use the commands that raise a window and its
	transients by default

	* transient.jl (indirect-transient-of-p, transient-group): new
	functions

	* transient.jl
	({raise,lower,raise-or-lower}-window-and-transients): new
	commands

	* groups.jl ({raise,lower,raise-lower}-group): use the new
	functions for stacking lists of windows

	* stacking.jl (raise-windows, lower-windows,
	raise-lower-windows): new functions for stacking groups of
	windows

	* raise-commands.jl (raise-transients-and-pass-through-click):
	new command

2000-07-02  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* window-history.jl (window-history-apply): use
	resize-window-with-hints* to apply any saved dimensions. Fixes
	bug of making windows too small

	* functions.jl (resize-window-with-hints*): new function,
	similar to resize-window-with-hints, but with dimensions
	specified in pixels

	* version 0.29

2000-07-01  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* gnome-int.jl (gnome-use-capplet): make this an option

	* workspace.jl (activate-workspace, send-window-to-workspace,
	copy-window-to-workspace): customizable commands
	(select-workspace:N, send-to-workspace:N, copy-to-workspace:N):
	deprecated, moved to compat.jl

	* viewport.jl (activate-viewport, move-window-to-viewport):
	customizable commands

	* viewport-linear.jl (set-viewport-linear,
	set-window-viewport-linear): customizable commands. Deprecate
	the rest

	* nokogiri-sawfish.jl: Set `deprecated-command' property of
	commands that I don't want to show up in the configurator
	(nokogiri-report-commands): new function.

	* keymaps.jl (custom-get-keymap, custom-set-keymap): allow
	non-symbol commands to pass through to the configurator if they
	specify the type of their argument list

	* functions.jl (run-shell-command): new command, forks its
	argument using `system', is customizable

	* custom.jl (define-command-args): new function, associates a
	custom type with a command, should describe the _list_ of
	arguments that can be given to the function (i.e. an `and'
	widget usually)

2000-06-30  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawmill.jl: add ~/.sawfish/lisp to load-path

	* groups.jl (send-group-to-workspace): remember to tell
	ws-move-window which workspace to move _from_. Also, don't try
	to move sticky windows

2000-06-29  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* match-window.jl (match-window-grab-x-property): tidied up,
	should handle non-string properties now

	* place-window.jl (place-window-centered,
	place-window-centered-on-parent, place-window-under-pointer):
	clamp the placement position into the current workarea (as
	defined by the windows that must not be covered)

	* functions.jl (clamp, clamp*): new functions

	* x-cycle.jl, workspace.jl, wm-spec.jl, viewport.jl,
	transient.jl, place-window.jl, nokogiri-sawfish.jl,
	move-resize.jl, maximize.jl, iconify.jl, functions.jl,
	frames.jl, edge-flip.jl, customize.jl, autoload.jl,
	audio-events.jl: various changes to defcustom's, mostly just
	trying to improve the descriptions

	* gnome.jl (gnome-honour-client-state): set `ignored' as well
	`never-focus' for SKIP_FOCUS windows

	* stacking.jl (mapped-stacking-order): new function, used to
	ignore unmapped windows when restacking

2000-06-28  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* nokogiri-sawfish.jl: server-side functions for nokogiri

	viewport.jl, tooltips.jl, stacking.jl, smart-placement.jl,
	slide-window.jl, size-window.jl, shade-hover.jl, sawmill.jl,
	play-audio.jl, nokogiri-sawfish.jl, move-resize.jl,
	move-cursor.jl, maximize.jl, match-window.jl, keymaps.jl,
	iconify.jl, group-funs.jl, gnome-match.jl, functions.jl,
	frames.jl, focus.jl, edge-flip.jl, customize.jl, custom.jl,
	configure.jl, autoload.jl, auto-raise.jl, audio-events.jl:
	Suitable changes for new `nokogiri' config interface

	sets `never-focus' property, not `ignored'

2000-06-27  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* groups.jl (raise-lower-group): try to be cleverer about
	detecting when to raise and when to lower. But it's still based
	on assumptions about the constraints..

	* stacking.jl (window-on-top-p, raise-lower-window): removed
	check for window visibility to latter

	* raise-commands.jl (raise-group-and-pass-through-click): new
	command

	* groups.jl (raise-group, lower-group, raise-lower-group):
	assume less, so they work better with the new stacking code

2000-06-26  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* stacking.jl: rewritten to be totally `constraint' based.
	(Actually these constraints are just predicates.) Anyway, this
	lets me generalize the layer code into one rule, and to do
	proper stacking of transients using other rules. (So, e.g.,
	when (eq transients-above 'parents), transient windows are
	actually only stacked _their own_ parents -- two people asked
	me for this today)

2000-06-24  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* iconify.jl (iconify-ignored): new option, whether or not to
	allow ignored windows to be iconified, nil by default. (Closes
	bugs.gnome #11114)

2000-06-23  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* frames.jl (frame-type-fallback-alist): map `shaded' and
	`shaded-transient' to `shaped' and `shaped-transient'

	`shaped-transient')

	* frames.jl (frame-part-classes): removed the cursor
	definitions from the `-button' classes

	* sawmill.jl: fixed bug of not load-all'ing site-init within
	the `sawfish' structure

2000-06-22  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* stacking.jl (restack-window): new function, given a window,
	ensure that it has a consistent place in the stacking order
	(stacking-after-map): don't call raise-window, just use
	restack-window to ensure consistency

	* functions.jl (member-if): new function

2000-06-21  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* workspace.jl (ws-add-window): if the window has a non-null
	set of workspaces, clear it before adding the window to each of
	these spaces, in case (/= logical-id actual-id)

	* match-window.jl: in `workspace' setter, use
	ws-window-set-workspaces not window-add-to-workspace; also the
	`workspaces' property must contain logical workspace ids before
	the add-window-hook has been run

	* window-history.jl: moved customizations to `placement' group.
	Changed menu items to be `Remember foo' not `Save foo'

2000-06-20  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* configure.jl (windows-intersect-p, window-occludes-p): new
	functions
	(configure-request-handler): handle the newly complex `stack'
	field of the request (with all relations and siblings)

	* window-history.jl (window-history-apply): ignore `dimensions'
	attribute if the size-hints has a `user-size' property

	* stagger-placement.jl: new placement mode

	* smart-placement.jl (sp-best-fit): don't discard possible
	placement with more than the minimum overlap, keep all points,
	but add a cost component function sp-cost:overlap that includes
	the overlap. Currently overlap is weighted to 75%, pointer and
	focus locality combine to give the other 25%

	* place-window.jl (place-window-centered-on-parent): ensure
	that the chosen position is never negative

2000-06-19  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* wm-spec.jl, decode-events.jl: s/0x/#x/

	* window-history.jl: ensure that our addition to
	before-add-window-hook is added at the end of the hook (i.e.
	after the session-management function)

2000-06-18  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawmill.jl, sawmill-gaol.jl, describe.jl: remove any
	rep-compatibility cruft, we require 0.12 now

	* window-history.jl: set the options to automatically save
	dimensions and state to nil (since the module may sometimes
	misidentify the `same' window)

2000-06-16  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* version 0.28.1

2000-06-15  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* custom.jl (custom-declare-variable): allow variables to be
	declare in the null (top-level) group

	* window-history.jl (window-history-key): for transient

2000-06-13  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* window-history.jl: don't save the `iconified' and `shaded'
	states (they relate to the current instance of the window
	only). Also when restoring window state, use the current value
	of window-history-states to decided which properties to update

	* iconify.jl (iconify-workspace-windows): new command

2000-06-12  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* version 0.28

	* frames.jl (find-frame-definition): detect and abort if
	frame-type-fallback-alist contains closed cycles

	launcher; also add a couple of GNOME menus to the Help menu

	* gnome-commands.jl (gnome-www-page, gnome-help-browser): new
	commands

	* decode-events.jl: support `super' modifier

2000-06-08  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* x-cycle.jl (cycle-windows): added a handler to catch unbound
	(non-release) events, store them, exit the command, but first
	tail-call the command bound to the saved event

	* gnome-int.jl: require customize at compile-time so that
	variables are defined..

2000-06-05  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawmill.jl: removed setting of fonts-are-fontsets, handled by
	C main ()

2000-05-31  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* window-history.jl: changed the option names, added a more
	extensive menu, with commands to explicitly save state

	* sawmill-defaults.jl: load window-history module

	* move-resize.jl (move-resize-motion): call
	while-{moving,resizing}-hook _before_ updating the status
	message

2000-05-30  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* smart-placement.jl (sp-prune-points): if the number of points
	is less than the maximum, randomly add points to make up the
	distance

	(sp-cost-from-distance): made this function not depend on the
	order of its input positions (doh!)

	(sp-cost-components): reversed the order of the individual
	cells

	* stacking.jl (stacking-after-map): raise the window _after_
	possibly moving it to a higher layer (else it may end up below
	the other windows in its layer)

2000-05-27  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* window-history.jl: added a custom property getter for `type',
	it groks window shading

2000-05-26  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* place-window.jl (acceptable-placement): require the `rects'
	feature [ patch from John H. Palmieri
	<palmieri@math.washington.edu> ]

2000-05-25  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* workspace.jl (display-window:uniconify-to-current-workspace):
	new option
	* iconify.jl (display-window-without-focusing): bind
	uniconify-to-current-workspace to the value of the above option
	before uniconifying
	[ adapted from from John N S Gill ]

	* prompt-extras.jl: don't bind special variables in parameter
	lists

2000-05-22  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* edge-flip.jl (edge-flip-warp-pointer): new option, whether or
	not to warp the pointer to the opposite screen edge after
	flipping (from Paul Warren <pdw@ferret.lmh.ox.ac.uk>)

2000-05-19  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* window-history.jl (window-history-apply): don't reposition
	windows whose `placed' property is already set

2000-05-17  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawmill-gaol.jl: added some more `x' functions

	* smart-placement.jl (sp-cost): split each cost component into
	a separate function, the variable sp-cost-components tells how
	to combine them into a single value

	* rects.jl (rectangle-center, rectangle-center*): new functions

	* place-window.jl (place-transient-mode): defaults to
	centered-on-parent

2000-05-16  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* beos-window-menu.jl: new file, replaces window-menu by
	something that creates sub-menus by window group

	* window-history.jl: use a hash table to record history

2000-05-15  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawmill-gaol.jl (sawmill-safe-specials): added batch-mode

	* frames.jl (frame-type-fallback-alist): variable mapping frame
	types to type to try if the original type isn't available in
	the chosen frame style
	(find-frame-definition): iterate over frame types using the
	above variable until a frame definition is found
	(set-window-frame-style): use find-frame-definition

	Note that for this to work, themes must return `nil' when they
	don't support the requested frame type, until now, the
	convention had been to return the default frame definition, so
	most if not all themes will need changing. Themes defined using
	the themer (or gimpmill?) will still work okay

	* make-theme.jl (make-theme): rewritten the returned lambda to
	conform to the new theme conventions

2000-05-14  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* window-history.jl: various enhancements, including: only save

	command to remove saved state for a window, customizations
	controlling what gets saved (position, size, or other)

	* frames.jl (set-window-frame-style, frame-style-menu): call
	window-state-changed-hook, with states `frame-style' and `type'

	* auto-raise.jl (raise-groups-on-focus): commented out this
	option, it causes window groups to flicker (sometimes
	repeatedly) in certain cases due to the extra focus events it
	causes

2000-05-12  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* gnome-menu.jl (gnome-menu-lang): now a list of strings, made
	by destructuring the language code, e.g. if LANG=de_DE, then
	the list will be ("de" "de_DE")

	(gnome-menu-read-desktop-entry): match encountered languages
	against all items in gnome-menu-lang

	* gnome-menu.jl, sawmill.jl: search LANGUAGE, LC_ALL,
	LC_MESSAGES, LANG for the language code to use, in that order

	* describe.jl (describe-symbol): new command, replaces
	describe-function and describe-variable

	(apropos-function, apropos-variable): moved these here from
	rep, this is necessary for rep 0.11+

	* keymap.jl (describe-key): use describe-symbol instead of
	describe-function

	* with-output.jl (define-command-to-screen): new macro, defines
	a command that will have its output redirected to the screen,
	given the name of an existing command to call, and an
	interactive spec

2000-05-11  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* focus.jl (focus-enter-fun, focus-enter-fun): generate events
	when the root window is entered/left, enter-root and leave-root
	(enter-exit): unfocus the window when the root window is
	entered, as well as when the window is left

	* transient.jl (transient-unmap-window): fix bug of looking for
	window under pointer _in_ click to focus mode, it should be
	only done when _not in_ this mode

2000-05-10  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* window-history.jl: new file, first attempt at remembering
	window state across window instances, still quite rough

	* version 0.27.1

	* 3d-hack.jl (3d-rotate flatten): use inexact->exact on
	transformed coordinates (fixes bug introduced by rounding
	functions now preserving inexactness)

	* maximize.jl (maximize-do-horizontal, maximize-do-vertical):
	use current-head-dimensions and current-head-offset of the
	maximized window to give the maximization bounds

	(maximize-find-max-rectangle): new optional arg HEAD, the head
	to constrain the rectangle to. Also, the output rectangle may
	only span a single head

	(maximize-do-both): constrain the maximized window to its
	current head

	* functions.jl (current-head, current-head-dimensions,
	current-head-offset): all now take an optional window
	parameter, which means to find the current head in relation to
	this window (else use the focused window)

	* functions.jl (get-window-by-name-re): new function

	* sawmill.jl: after renaming .sawmill -> .sawfish, create a
	symlink .sawmill in case user code refers to it

2000-05-09  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* version 0.27

	* transient.jl (transient-unmap-window): misc improvements,
	should fix the reported problems in click-to-focus mode

	* window-order.jl (window-order-most-recent): new function

	* focus.jl (focus-click): only pass events through to the
	window if they're not bound, _and_ none of their successor
	events (move, release, etc) are bound

	* decode-events.jl (should-grab-button-event-p): new function,
	returns t if a button event needs to be grabbed so that the
	events that follow it are received

	* transient.jl (transient-map-window): only ever focus the
	window if it's visible (i.e. on the current workspace and not
	iconified)

2000-05-08  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* viewport.jl (window-outside-workspace-p): handle non-zero
	viewport origins correctly (I think)

	* iconify.jl (ws-set-client-state): add this function to
	`map-notify-hook' instead of `add-window-hook', since the wm
	deletes WM_STATE when windows are withdrawn (one of the
	alternatives suggested by the icccm). This fixes the Code
	Crusader bug

2000-04-30  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* shade-hover.jl (shade-hover-delay): changed range lower limit
	from one to zero (from Nils Barth <nbarth@fas.harvard.edu>)

	* stacking.jl (raise-window): check that (/= pred w) before
	using it to raise above (else, do nothing, since it means that
	w is already on top)

2000-04-29  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* workspace.jl (workspace-swap-in): use move-resize-window-to
	so that window reconfiguration happens in one step, not two

	* edges.jl, rects.jl: removed uses of `named let' construct,
	only later sub-versions of required rep 0.11 support it

	* stacking.jl (raise-window): should have fixed long-standing
	problem of raising managed windows above override_redirect
	windows (e.g. menus) in certain cases

2000-04-28  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* functions.jl (current-head): use focused window to determine
	current head, only use pointer position if no focused window

2000-04-27  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawmill-gaol.jl: added window-icon-image to list

	* rectangles.jl (rectangle-area, rect-1d-overlap): changed from
	macros to functions
	(rectangle-from-coords, rectangle-corners): new functions
	(rectangle-heads): return the number of screen heads that a
	given rectangle appears on

	* smart-placement.jl (sp-least-overlap): ignore points where
	the window appear on more than one screen head

	* edges.jl (get-visible-window-edges): when :include-root
	option is given, include edges of all the screen's heads

	* place-window.jl (place-window-randomly,
	place-window-centered): support multi-headed screens

	* functions.jl (current-head, current-head-dimensions,
	current-head-offset): convenience functions (uses pointer
	position to define current head)

	* functions.jl (screen-dimensions): new function

2000-04-26  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* edge-flip.jl: moved `edge-flip' group under `workspaces'

	* sm-save.jl, sm-init.jl, sawmill.jl, play-audio.jl, menus.jl,
	make-theme-preview.jl, gtkrc.jl, gnome-int.jl, frames.jl,
	customize.jl, custom.jl, compat.jl, autoload.jl, Makefile.in:
	s/sawmill/sawfish/ where appropriate

2000-04-24  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* tooltips.jl: put `tooltips' customization group under `misc'

2000-04-20  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* auto-raise.jl (raise-groups-on-focus): new option (in
	focus/advanced)

	* groups.jl (raise-group, lower-group): preserve the stacking
	order of the group, then raise/lower the indicated window
	(raise-lower-group): new command

	* group-funs.jl (windows-by-group, windows-in-group): added an
	optional parameter `BY-DEPTH', when t the windows are returned
	by order of depth, not creation time

2000-04-18  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* workspace.jl (workspace-menu): fixed to put the focus marking
	asterisk when using workspace names (from John N S Gill)

	custom-option-alist and custom-group-option-alist

	* custom.jl (custom-groups, custom-required,
	custom-quoted-keys, custom-option-alist,
	custom-group-option-alist): these are now lexically bound

2000-04-14  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* play-audio.jl (play-sample): run audio playing programs
	asynchronously so they can't block the wm

	* menus.jl (popup-menu): only set the frame-draw-mutex if
	there's a clicked frame part. This is still a kludge..

	* menus.jl: added some underscores marking menu accelerators

	* place-window.jl (place-window-interactively): set
	move-outline-mode to `box' not `nil' (from Timo Korvola)

2000-04-09  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* version 0.26

	* sawmill.jl: don't load sawmill-gaol until all functions it

	*user-structure* to suitable values; support load-all variants;
	try to decide when to `load' and when to `require' command line
	arguments

	* sawmill-gaol.jl: should now support both rep 0.12+ and
	0.11- gaols

	* tooltips.jl, edge-flip.jl, customize.jl, custom.jl: minor
	tweaks to work with modularized rep

2000-03-30  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	to samples, finding and playing samples)

2000-03-27  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* smart-placement.jl (sp-avoided-windows-weight): increased by
	an order of magnitude (mentioned by Dan Winship)

	* place-window.jl (place-window-randomly): use
	maximize-find-workarea then randomize within that part of the
	screen

	* maximize.jl (maximize-find-max-rectangle): new function,
	broken out of maximize-do-both

	required)

2000-03-21  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* window-outline.jl (draw-window-outline,

	* workspace.jl, transient.jl, stacking.jl, group-funs.jl,

	* edges.jl (get-visible-window-edges): new arg :windows,

	close-parenthesis

1999-08-01  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* workspace.jl (ws-remove-window): fix the bug whereby deleting
	the last workspace didn't nullify ws-current-workspace. Also
	ensure that both remove-from-workspace and
	delete-workspace-hook are only called _after_ the deletion has
	occurred. remove-from-workspace now gets two args: window and
	workspace

1999-07-31  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* workspace.jl: new hook `delete-workspace-hook'

	is allowed to stay running between menus being required.
	Default is one minute

	* simple.jl, brushed-metal.jl, absolute-e.jl: changes for
	framesets

	* transient.jl: introduce the frameset idea, an alist of frames

	* auto-raise.jl: new file, uses a timer to work correctly
	(raise-windows-on-focus): can now be a regexp matching window
	names to raise
	* focus.jl: removed the auto-raise stuff

1999-07-28  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* workspace.jl (next-workspace-window): new command

	* focus.jl (focus-raise): synchronise the server before timing
	out

1999-07-28  Stewart Perry  <scp@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* focus.jl (raise-windows-on-focus, raise-window-timeout): new
	variables, auto-raise functionality

1999-07-28  John Harper  <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>

	* sawmill-defaults.jl: set the frame to `nil-frame' to turn off
	the frame, not to nil

	* transient.jl (transient-add-window): only set the frame if
	it's currently nil, set it to default-frame if not transient or
	shaped

	* simple.jl, brushed-metal.jl, absolute-e.jl: frames are
	defined as lists now

	* absolute-e.jl: added shaped and shaped-transient frames

	* workspace.jl (cycle-through-workspaces,
	delete-workspaces-when-empty, uniconify-to-current-workspace,
	static-workspace-menus): new variables
	(workspace-menu, window-menu): dynamic menu constructors
	(iconify-window, uniconify-window): new commands

	* sawmill.jl: load some more libraries

	* place-window.jl: this uses the new place-window-hook. But
	random placement is still the only working option

	* move-resize.jl: now obeys most of the window's size hints
	(all but the aspect ratios)

	* menus.jl: implement popup menus using the sawmill-ui script

	* functions.jl (get-window-by-name, get-window-by-id): new
	functions
