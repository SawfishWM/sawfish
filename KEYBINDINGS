This is the complete list of default sawfish keybindings.
You can use xmodmap (among other tools) to change your keyboard layout,
and xev to check what key and button presses are generated.

Keyboard features in Sawfish are explained in this file, too.

Key Descriptions
================

Modifiers:
W = Default Modifier Key
H = Hyper
M = Meta
C = Control
S = Shift
A = Alt
Super

W, the "default modifier"

Mod(5...) = Additional Modifiers, eg: Alt Gr or Compose

dead_circumflex = ^
degree = °

Left = Left Arrow Key
Right = Right Arrow Key
Up = Up Arrow Key
Down = Down Arrow Key

! Currently sawfish ignores caps lock, num lock, and screen lock.
! Even if they're on, Sawfish reports as if they're not.

! The following table is not universal. It depends on each keyboard.
When Num_Lock is off:

KP_Insert = Keypad Insert (0)
KP_End = Keypad End (1)
KP_Down = Keypad Down Arrow Key (2)
KP_Next = Keypad Page Down (3)
KP_Left = Keypad Left Arrow Key (4)
KP_Begin = Keypad Middle (5)
KP_Right = Keypad Right Arrow Key (6)
KP_Home = Keypad Pos1 (7)
KP_Up = Keypad Up Arrow Key (8)
KP_Prior = Keypad Page Up (9)

When Num_Lock is on:

KP_0: Keypad 0
KP_1: Keypad 1
KP_2: Keypad 2
KP_3: Keypad 3
KP_4: Keypad 4
KP_5: Keypad 5
KP_6: Keypad 6
KP_7: Keypad 7
KP_8: Keypad 8
KP_9: Keypad 9

Independent of Num_Lock:

KP_Enter = Keypad Enter
KP_Divide = Keypad /
KP_Multiply = Keypad *
KP_Substract = Keypad -
KP_Add = Keypad +
KP_Delete = Keypad Delete (,)

Pointer_EnableKeys = Shift + Num_Lock, allows moving the pointer via the KeyPad

BS = Backspace
DEL = Delete
Next = Page Down
Prior = Page Up
End = End
Pause = Pause
Insert = Insert
Print = Print
Home = Pos1

ESC = Escape
Tab = Tabulator Key

ISO_Left_Tab = Same as Shift + TAB
ISO_Level3_Shift = Switch to third layer

Scroll_Lock = Scroll
Num_Lock = Num
Multikey = Compose

XF86AudioPlay = Play/Pause Key
XF86AudioMute = Mute Key
XF86AudioStop = Stop Key

XF86AudioPrev = Previous Track Key
XF86LowerVolume = Lower Volume Key
XF86RaiseVolume = Raise Volme Key
XF86AudioNext = Next Track Key

XF86Back = Back Key
XF86Forward = Next Key
XF86Stop = Cancel Key
XF86Reload = Reload Key

XF86WWW = Browser Key
XF86Mail = Mail Key
X86Search = Search  Key
XF86Favorites = Favorites Key
XF86Standby = Sleep Key

! Button mapping depends. For example, left handed people may set
! the right button as "button 1".
Button1 = Left Mouse Button
Button2 = Middle Mouse Button/Scroll Wheel (Often emulated by button presses 1 and 3 at once.)
Button3 = Right Mouse Button
Button4 = Scroll Wheel Up
Button5 = Scroll Wheel Down

Off = When Mouse Button Is Released
Off1 = Same as Off
Off2 = When Mouse Button Is Released Twice
Click = When Mouse Button Is Clicked
Click1 = Same as Click
Click2 = When Mouse Button Is Clicked Twice
Move = When Button Is Clicked and Pointer Moved

Setting Keybindings
===================

To set keybinding from lisp:

( bind-keys keymap "key" 'action )

for example:

( bind-keys global-keymap "W-Tab" 'cycle-windows )

how to unset keybindings manually:

( unbind-keys keymap "keybindings" 'action )

for example:

( unbind-keys global-keymap "W-Tab" 'cycle-windows )

Keymap for specific application
===============================

It's possible to have a keymap for a specific application only.  For
example, you can use `nautilus-keymap' which is active when Nautilus
is focused. All other key events are ignored, that is, events not in
`nautilus-keymap' are not captured by Sawfish, but sent to Nautilus.
That means that `window-keymap' gets ignored in nautilus. (Internally,
`window-keymap' is set to all windows when they appear, but a window
specific keymap simply replaces the default.)

( define nautilus-keymap ( make-keymap ) )
( bind-keys nautilus-keymap
  "C-q" 'destroy-window-safely
  "C-l" 'lower-window
  "C-r" 'raise-window )

( add-window-matcher '( ( WM_CLASS . "^Nautilus/nautilus$" ) )
       '( ( keymap . ,nautilus-keymap ) ) )

So now Sawfish only has 3 keybindings for Nautilus.

Keymap Transistion
==================

Sawfish is also able to `translate' a keypress to different one. For
example, assume you want to create a new tab in Guake (a dropdown
terminal emulator) by pressing C-n instead of C-S-t (the Guake
default). Then put:

( add-window-matcher '( ( WM_CLASS . "^Guake.py/guake.py$" ) )
       '( ( keymap-trans . ( ( "C-n" "C-S-t" ) ) ) ) )

This is also useful in conjunction with an application specific
keymap, to prevent colliding bindings.

Nested Keybindings (Macros)
===========================

another thing would be nested keybindings (I prefer `macros' instead of `nested keyinbindgs'),
like in emacs. nested means you first press keys which together act as a new modifier
(this new modifier works like the compose key does -> you don't have to keep it pressed, like other modifiers),
then you press another key (or keybinding) to actually perform the desired action, example:

;; create a new meta-keymap called apps-keymap
( define apps-keymap ( make-keymap ) )

;; glue it into the global-keymap, make the apps-keymap modifier W-e (WM-Modifier + e)
( bind-keys global-keymap "W-e" apps-keymap )

;; add bindings to the apps-keymap
( bind-keys apps-keymap "b" '( system "bluefish &" ) )

now first press "W-e" (as I said no need to keep it pressed) and press b, now bluefish starts.

Default Keymaps and Keybindings
===============================
"Toggle" in the command name means switching between "on" and "off".
