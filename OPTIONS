;; OPTIONS
;; =======

;; This file lists all of sawfish's low-level configuration options,
;; including both those that can be set through the UI can those that
;; can't. For most options it also shows their default value, or how
;; that value is initially computed.

;; To use this file, either copy it to ~/.sawfishrc and uncomment and
;; change the lines containing the options you want to modify, or just
;; use it as a reference when editing your own .sawfishrc

;; Note that some of the pages of options start with a commented out
;; "require" statement. If you change any of those options you'll also
;; need to uncomment that require statement, to ensure that the module
;; implementing the options gets loaded.

;; Please send any comments to the sawfish mailing list:
;; <sawfish-list@gnome.org>

;; Good luck!
