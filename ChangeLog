			    and `map-windows delete-window' before actually rebooting or halting,
			    to ensure everything is fine on the next startup. Furthermore

			 it to be unmapped, as this may let several windows disappear at once randomly
			 not just the one that sent the request, this bug appears mostly in Xinerama
			 setups, but is not limited to it. The change is not 100% failsafe at the moment
			 but it reduces the failure-rate by 95% which is the reason why it is integrated
			 while not beeing final. [Janek Kozicki]

	* lisp/sawfish/wm/commands/grow-pack.jl: Make grow/pack Xinerama aware. Old implementations supported only 1
						 Head, current does 3, but needs to be extended to support atleast 4.

	* configure.in: version 1.3.2

	* documentation from Derek Upham v0.12

	* Updated Occitan translation (Yannig Marchegay)

	* patch by Luis Rodrigo Gallardo Cruz taken upstream from debian:
	http://sawfish.wikia.com/wiki/Noprop_desktop_save
	Sawfish saves the size of the desktop window, and although nautilus
	requests the widget to be the same size as your screen it's forced to
	the size that sawfish saved.

	The current Sawfish.desktop file did not comply with the
	freedesktop.org standard.

	* patch by Timo Korvola: http://sawfish.wikia.com/wiki/Reparenting_cleanup
	This fixes reparenting fights that occur between Sawfish and the KDE
	system tray. Both try to reparent system tray icons as they are
	mapped, leading to a lot of flicker and an unpredictable end result.

	* patch by Rodrigo Gallardo: http://sawfish.wikia.com/wiki/Net_wm_properties
	strings are re-encoded in UTF8
	window titles will be set correctly regardless of title encoding
	(useful when browsing foreign pages).

	* patch by Timo Korvola: http://sawfish.wikia.com/wiki/KDE_system_tray_fix
	With this it will ignore out of bounds _NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP requests silently.
	KDE system tray apps have a nasty habit of sending
	_NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP client messages with a parameter of -1, which
	confuses Sawfish. This patch adds some bounds checking.

	* patch by Harald van Dijk: http://sawfish.wikia.com/wiki/KDE_menus_focus
	QT applications were losing focus when menu was active.

	* patch by Fuchur and Andrea Vettorello:
	http://sawfish.wikia.com/wiki/Multihead_placed_patch

	Also, moved all button theme definitions into the special
	variable Crux:button-themes, then the button-theme function
	just dereferences this
